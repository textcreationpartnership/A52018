            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IF thou art skilled in good Authors, I freely make thee Judge of theſe Papers, and covet thy Admonition, if thou ſeest any thing Material amiſs in them, defiring nothing more than that Truth may take place. I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to ſay to thee, if thou art what I ſuppoſe thee to be.</p>
            <p>But if thou art leſs ſeen in Books, I crave leave to give thee ſome Advice.

            <p>If thou findeſt that not one Perſon of that Communion, meaſuring his State by their own Doctrine, can be certain whether he enjoys the Ordinary Means appointed by God for Man's Salvation, (which I pretend to prove) I would oblige thee to theſe few Things,

                     <hi>2.</hi> To praiſe God thou art in Communion with the Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd Church of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe Faith reſts <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nmoveable upon the Holy Scripture and Ancient Creeds, and whoſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment

Let neither a fond Affection to Novelty, nor a groundleſs Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of Miſ-called-Antiquity turn thee aſide from the <hi>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Old Paths.</hi> In Order to This, strive to work thy Soul to an high Eſteem of Truth and Peace, the two Grand Legacies our dear Lord hath leſt his Church: For Theſe cannot be in ſafe Keeping, unleſs the Heart aſſist the Head, in Order to their ſafeguard. Cold Speculation ſecures not from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency of Temptations.

            <p>Now if thou expectest to be aſſisted with ſome previous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, for thy more <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeful Reading of what follows; Know, I need but give thee Little here, having all-along in my paſſage enlarged (ſome will ſay, to a fault) on ſeveral Heads, that I might acquaint thee with the whole Nature of the Subject, treated of. The Fourth Part of what I have written, might, I ſuppoſe, have ſufficed to have let my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary know my Mind, ſo far as he hath obliged me to impart it. The Rest is employed in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfolding Things for thy ſake. And more I would have done for thee in this kind, had not the Multiplicity of my Affairs, which for many Years have divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded my Endeavours into ſeveral Chanels, allowed me onely much interrupted parcels of time for this Occaſion.</p>
            <p>Being jealous of being miſ-underſtood, I ſhall explain a few things here, which otherwiſe might poſſibly chance to be a Stumbling-block in thy Way.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> I frequently call men <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Biſhops,</hi> whil'ſt I am queſtioning whether they be truly Such. And I ſay, They <hi>Baptize</hi> and <hi>Ordain,</hi> whil'ſt I question the validity of thoſe Acts. Which may ſeem to thee a ſort of Contradiction.</p>
            <p>But know, all Authors ſpeak in the like manner, who ſpeak of the like Matters, I deal with. The meaning is but this,
<pb facs="tcp:50192:3"/>We call them <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Biſhops,</hi> becauſe the Matter and Form of Ordination hath been Outwardly applied to them, and they are therefore <hi>reputed</hi> ſuch. In like ſort, I. ſay, They <hi>Baptize, Conſecrate,</hi> &amp;c. When the Outward Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Action is performed, and They are therefore reputed to do ſo.</p>
            <p>But ſince the <hi>Roman</hi> Church declares, That an inward inviſible Act of the Minister's Will, called his <hi>Intention,</hi> is neceſſary to the perfecting Ordination and Baptiſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I therefore question How her <hi>reputed</hi> Priests or Biſhops can be known to be <hi>true</hi> Priests, or Biſhops: Or their <hi>reputed</hi> Baptiſm, <hi>true</hi> Baptiſne, according to their Doctrine.</p>
            <p>To ſave a Circuit of Words, Men generally ſpeak, as is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid; and the Meaning of the Words is eaſily known by the other Words they are connected with, in the Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Note, when at any time I call the Church of <hi>Rome The</hi> Church, it is where the Contexture of the Matter obligeth me to accommodate my Language to them, and not otherwiſe: for I am fully ſatisfied the <hi>Roman</hi> is out a Church, not <hi>the</hi> Church; <hi>viz.</hi> but a particular, not the univerſal Church.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> If at any time I ſay to this Effect, — <hi>Ordination and your other Sacraments,</hi> I do but occaſionally ſuit my Words to theirs; as not at all approving their Number of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. God hath blest me with better eye ſight, I praiſe his Name for it, than to agree with the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in any One point, wherein She diſagrees with the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I add, Thou art not in a Diſcourſe of this Nature to expect a Stile dreſs'd with brisk Metaphors, or pretty little Turns of Wit, nor yet with much variety of Words. To ſpeak openly and with ſure dependence, is the Province of a Diſputant, and all that a Wiſe man looks for from him.</p>
            <p>This is all I had a mind to tell thee, and ſo I bid thee heartily <hi>Farewell.</hi>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WERE You and I called to repreſent all the accidental Diſcourſe that paſſed between us, when I was laſt at Your Houſe, I fear we ſhould vary in our Reports: for when you undertook within an hour after to tell part of it at the Inn, you found your ſelf to be contradicted by thoſe that heard us. And indeed, we penetrated ſo little into the Merits of any Point we ſpoke of, (but how that hapned our Auditors can beſt ſay) that it would not be worth the while either for us to tell, or others to hear, the unready fruitleſs ſtory of it.</p>
            <p>However, to make way to our preſent buſineſs, I think fit to entertain the Readers (for as your Papers have already, ſo mine may meet with more eyes than
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50192:6"/>yours and mine) with a little of what paſſed before the cloſe of our Altercations. Which being done, I ſhall proceed to the work which you have ſince ſcored out for me. And for better Order-ſake, and that you may with more eaſe let me know the Faults you find with me, I ſhall divide my Paper into ſeveral Sections and and Paragraphs.</p>
            <div n="1" type="section">
               <head>
                  <hi>SECT. I.</hi> Matter of Fact related.</head>
               <p n="1">§. 1. WHEN you alledged that our Orders in the Church of <hi>England</hi> were <hi>invalid,</hi> in the judgment of <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, (a thing I could not wonder at, having cauſe to believe <hi>You</hi> had renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them) I ſtraight juſtified them by thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> unto which our firſt Reformed Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops were admitted. You ſaid, They had indeed been good, had our Biſhops kept to the old Ordinal; but that They forſook <hi>it,</hi> and only gave power to <hi>diſpenſe</hi> the Word and Sacraments, which any Deacon might do: and that afterwards, perceiving the Nullity that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by it, They again alter'd the Form, and gave power to do the Office of a Prieſt. Thus you.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. TO <hi>this</hi> I returned, That Words and Phraſes might be changed, and yet their matter remain the ſame: and that ſo it was in this caſe. You took the word <hi>diſpenſe,</hi> I told you, in too narrow and crampt a ſenſe, making it denote only <hi>diſtribution,</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Euchariſt; whereas Our Church made it <hi>there</hi> ſignifie Conſecration alſo. I added, Scripture-Language would ſecure us in this: for S. <hi>Paul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſets forth the entire Office of the Goſpel-Miniſtry by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> of the Goſpel; and all Goſpel-Miniſters (thoſe of the higheſt rank not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted)
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50192:6"/>by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Diſpenſers</hi> of the Myſteries of God. Which you could not gain ſay.</p>
               <p>And hence I concluded, that the <hi>Alteration ſpoken of,</hi> was Verbal only, and not Material.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. This ended, to occaſion you to take a view of ſome Fetters which the <hi>Roman</hi> Church had put upon her own claims, I denied that She could be certain, <hi>according to her own principles,</hi> that ſhe hath any true Prieſthood. I thought, Sir, ſome of your Councils had put the ſtamp of Faith upon a Doctrin which would in its juſt conſequences ſo far blot the Evidences of your Prieſthood, (and of all other your things that depend upon it) as to make them not certainly Legible, and therefore I uſed thoſe words—<hi>according to your own principles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And finding you not forward to prevent me by proving the Affirmative, I gained your leave to make good the Negative, which I attempted to do by the following Argument.</p>
               <q>
                  <p n="4">§. 4. <hi>All Churches that make Prieſtly Ordination de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon a Condition, that no man living knows whether it be fulfill'd, muſt be uncertain, whether they have any true Prieſthood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But the</hi> Roman <hi>Church makes Prieſtly Ordination de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon a Condition, that no man living knows whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be fulfill'd:</hi> Ergo,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The</hi> Roman <hi>Church muſt be uncertain whether ſhe hath any true Prieſthood.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p n="5">§. 5. When I complained of your repeating my Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſm imperfectly, you alledged it was a long one, and therefore deſired me to write it down for the help of your memory. To gratifie you, I writ the whole as it ſtands, ſaving, that I only hinted the praedicate of the <hi>Minor,</hi> as ſufficient for your help.</p>
               <p>After peruſal of it you denied the <hi>Minor,</hi> which I proved thus,</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:50192:7"/>
               <q>
                  <p n="6">§. 6. The Intention of the Biſhop is a Condition, which no man living knows whether it be fulfill'd or no.</p>
                  <p>But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> requires the Intention of the Biſhop to Ordination: <hi>Ergo,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> requires a Condition to Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which no man living knows whether it be fulfilled or no.</p>
               </q>
               <p n="7">§. 7. Now, in compliance with the words of the former Syllogiſm (not adverted to, through haſt, when I form'd the Second) I ſhall preſent the Matter of this latter <hi>thus,</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>The Intention of the Biſhop is a Condition, that no man living knows whether it be fulfill'd.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Roman</hi> Church makes Ordination depend upon the Intention of the Biſhop: <hi>Ergo,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Church makes Ordination depend upon a Condition that no man living knows whether it be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd.</p>
               </q>
               <p>I have not, Sir, made this digreſſion for your ſake, who did not before by word, nor ſince by writing, find the leaſt fault with my <hi>barely</hi> verbal Alteration: I did it only out of a reſpect to Decorum. But I muſt go on with it a little for the ſake of the leſs diſcerning Reader.</p>
               <p>The <hi>minor</hi> Propoſitions, wherein the variation lies, I will place together, for the more eaſie compariſon of them.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> requires the Intention of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop to Ordination.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Church makes Ordination depend upon the Intention of the Biſhop.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Upon the firſt view of them thus placed, it appears that they are equivalent Propoſitions, giving the very ſame ſenſe; and ſo are both alike true, or both alike falſe. For by the word <hi>requires,</hi> I mean, requires <hi>as neceſſary.</hi> This I have added, leſt any ſhould be apt to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50192:7"/>conclude, They ſee another perſon becauſe they ſee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other dreſs.</p>
               <p>But to return from this unneceſſary Digreſſion.</p>
               <p>You denyed the <hi>Major</hi> of my ſecond Syllogiſm, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that it was not univerſally true, foraſmuch as the Ordaining Biſhops knew whether they intended to Ordain or no.</p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. To this I replied, by Explicating what I meant by theſe words, <hi>the Intention of the Biſhop, viz.</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of ſuch as were <hi>truly and indeed</hi> Biſhops. Upon which I added, That your Biſhops know not whether they exert that Intention which your Church requires to Ordination, for want of certainty that thoſe duely Intended who Ordained them, and conſequently that themſelves are true Biſhops. For it is not the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a man conſider'd otherwiſe than as a true Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, that will ſerve to the purpoſe of Ordination. Nor can any Biſhop be ſurer that <hi>his</hi> Intention (toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the due application of Matter and Form) is effectual to Ordination, than he is, that <hi>his,</hi> who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to Ordain him, was ſo. But how he ſhould be certain of that, I am to learn.</p>
               <p n="9">§. 9. The Sum then is, Nothing ſhort of all this I have expreſt, will reach home to the purpoſes of your Church; and therefore your Councils have fallen ſhort of their main end, if in handling this matter they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire not <hi>all this</hi> in their Definitions; or at leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe not that part of it as neceſſary, which they do not formally require. And ſure I am, That none is more ſure that he Intends as a Biſhop, than he is ſure, That he is a Biſhop: Which aſſurance he may begin to ſeek when he pleaſes, but I am confident he will never find it, till he hath found a Caſement in his Ordainer's breaſt, through which he may view his very heart.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> then (for ought I ſee) remains true in the moſt extended ſignification of the words, no man
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50192:8"/>living (no, not the Ordaining Biſhops themſelves) knowing that the Condition of the requiſite, effectual Intention of any Biſhop is fulfill'd in Ordination.</p>
               <p>Although, Sir, I ſpoke not all theſe words to you, yet you know I expreſt the full matter of them.</p>
               <p n="10">§. 10. But becauſe you was not ſatisfied with this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (but why you ſhould not, let others judge) I limited the Signification of thoſe words [no man living] by contradiſtinguiſhing <hi>all men</hi> to the Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Biſhops. And then the ſenſe ſtood thus, No man living, except the Ordaining Biſhops, know whether the required Intention be preſent in Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Ordinations. Which explication of the words you accepted.</p>
               <p>I was well content, I confeſs, to take up with this for that time, as thinking with my ſelf, That the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts might well forbear their mighty claims, if it could be made appear (and this I never doubted) That no Prieſt, nor Deacon, nor Sub-deacon, nor any of the leſſer Orders, nor any one Lay-perſon amongſt them can be certain, That there is any true Prieſthood in that Church, nor any true Sacraments given or received in it.</p>
               <p n="11">§. 11. I would with your patience, add one thing more. Immediately after. I had received my Paper from you, you demanded to have it in keeping: and when I told you there was no reaſon you ſhould have my Script in exchange for your vaniſht breath, you acted a ſort of triumph, telling me I durſt not give it, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſcious to my ſelf of its infirmities. You too often dared me to give it you, with repeated promiſes you would anſwer it. At laſt, wearied with importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, I gave it, and you engaged to anſwer it, under your hand.</p>
               <p>I have not reported this out of any deſign to blame your zeal, but to let others know you may thank your
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50192:8"/>ſelf for it, if I chance to toil you a little more than you have a mind of.</p>
               <p n="12">§. 12. Sir, I hope your memory when a little rubb'd up, will ſerve to aſſure you, That what I have now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated as matter of Fact, is ſubſtantially true. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I am ready to give you a Certificate of any part of it, which you ſhall pleaſe to queſtion, Signed by the hands of the then preſent Gentlemen.</p>

                  <hi>SECT. II.</hi> Mr. <hi>G.</hi> unſeaſonably calls for Explication of Terms. His requeſt is granted. The Order of proceeding in it ſet forth.</head>
               <p n="1">§. 1. NOW I come to acknowledge the receit of your Letter, dated <hi>London September</hi> 29. in Anſwer to my Paper delivered to you about the <hi>Sixth</hi> of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> It is, I hope, the iſſue of mature advice and deliberation, and therefore may ſave me the trouble of expecting from you any thing of greater moment on this ſubject. 'Tis ſome ſatisfaction to know the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſtrength of an enemy. You pronounce it a <hi>full Anſwer</hi> to my Argument; and <hi>full</hi> admits not of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe. You alſo inſinuate it probable that I may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in it, which indeed I ought to do if it be a full Anſwer; Truth being the thing you and I are to run in queſt of, and to reſt in, being found. But if I chance not to ſee your Anſwer <hi>ſuch,</hi> (as in truth, I cannot, for want of eye-ſight, or for want of Object) and will therefore purſue the point further, you invite me to ſtate the Caſe diſtinctly and clearly. Your words are theſe,</p>
               <q>
                  <p n="2">§. <hi>2.</hi> If you have any thing more to Offer againſt us, be pleaſed to ſtate the point diſtinctly and clearly, by telling us what ſort of Intention you think is required in theſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50192:9"/>Councils, [<hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Trent</hi>] as a Principle of our Church, when you ſay, That the Intention of the Biſhop is a Condition which no man living, <hi>viz.</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinguiſhed from the Ordaining Miniſter, knows whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be fulfilled, or no. Whether you think an Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual, Actual or Virtual Intention be there declared; and whether ſuch as is converſant about the Act which is exerciſed, or about the End; and whether this End be Proximate or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltimate. As alſo what certainty you ſpeak of in your Propoſitions, whether it be Moral, Metaphyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal or Mathematical. That ſo I may return you a diſtinct anſwer.</p>
               </q>
               <p n="3">§. 3. Sir, Your requeſt that I would explicate the Terms in my Propoſitions, is reaſonable; but it had been more reaſonable you ſhould have made it ſooner, if you really doubted of my meaning in them. Firſt, to write a deliberate Anſwer from a ſeven weeks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the Terms I uſed, and after that to ask the meaning of them, is wonderful inartificial: ſuch a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as a perſon of your ſtanding in an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity is ſeldom guilty of.</p>
               <p>While you look upon my Words as Equivocal, you can faſten no determinate ſenſe on them, and then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you had run through all the various ſignifications of them, and ſhew'd that none of them would be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to me againſt your Church, you have anſwer'd but at a venture, and fought hoodwinkt.</p>
               <p>Had you proceeded after this manner: Sir, If you mean, That the Intention is required to be converſant only about the Sacramental Act, none in his wits can miſs it; and ſo no uncertainty ariſeth thence: if about the end, you miſtake our doctrine; or, we are ſure the Miniſters of the Sacraments, always carry their Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo far. If you mean an actual Intention is required, you miſunderſtand our Church; if an habitual or vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, this is indeed required, but then the Miniſters can never fail of Intending ſo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:50192:9"/>
               <p>Had you done this, you had not needed now to crave of me the Explication of the Terms, as having your ſelf met with them in all their ſhapes, and rendred them unuſeful to my intereſt. But not having done this (as will appear beneath) you have run the risk of making an impertinent anſwer, whatſoever it may prove to be, at laſt.</p>
               <p>Not to ſpeak <hi>ad idem,</hi> is to ſpeak to no purpoſe, and you know not you have ſpoke <hi>ad idem,</hi> till you know what I mean.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. Had you askt me at <hi>Preſcot</hi> what I meant by them, I muſt have told you, or become the object of your ſcorn: for he that cannot explain the Words he hath ſpoken by way of Argument againſt another, will be thought to want common Wit, or Language; and he that will not explain them to a fair inquirer will be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected to have ſpoken no good ſenſe. But you were not then doubtful of the Terms, as appeared by your bare denying a Propoſition, without more ado.</p>
               <p n="5">§ 5. Or, had you, by the Poſt, called me ſhortly after, to this performance, I muſt for the ſame reaſons have been your Obedient Servant. But not to ask this till your Anſwer was given, is a very great rarity.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. However, though it come unſeaſonably for your ſelf, your requeſt is juſt, and I will ſet my ſelf to fulfil it. And I ſhall the more largely explicate the Terms you mention, (with ſome other things, if I find, as I go on, that occaſion requires it) for the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pler ſatisfaction of the Reader; for ſaving my ſelf all future trouble in this kind; and for bringing the matter in Controverſie to a more evident period.</p>
               <p>In Order to this work, I ſhall require that two things be granted me by the Romaniſts.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. 1. That when your Councils ſpeak of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Miniſters of the Sacraments, they mean ſomething by their Words; and alſo expreſs their Senſe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50192:10"/>in ſuch ſort that it may be underſtood. To deny me this would be to blaſt the reputation of your Oracles.</p>
               <p n="8">§ 8. 2. That the Romaniſts, (at leaſt) whoſe Faith is guided by, or reſted upon ſuch Councils, are, and have been able to declare the true Senſe of their Decrees and Definitions. This follows from the other: for if the Councils writ intelligibly (which I take for granted) the Romaniſts have concern enough to inquire into, and skill enough to find out their Senſe; and therefore ſhall be concluded to have done ſo.</p>
               <p>This being premiſed, I ſhall explicate the Terms (ſo far as is needful) from Roman-Catholick Authors. What they mean by them, I muſt mean by them; otherwiſe our Controverſie can be nothing elſe but a ſtrife about words.</p>
               <p n="9">§. 9. To do this more Orderly, I ſhall ſhew, (1.) What your Councils ſay of the Intention: (2.) In what manner of quality, or under what Notion they require it, with relation to the Sacraments: whereof they make Orders one. (3.) About what it is conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant there. (4.) What ſort of Intention is required. (5.) What certainty I ſpeak of, when I deny that the Roman Church is certain of her having any true Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. This done, I ſhall attempt to judge of the ſtrength or weakneſs of your Anſwer, according to the ſtate of the Queſtion.</p>

               <p n="2">§. 2. The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> in the year 1547. the 7th. <hi>Seſſion, 11th. Canon (De Sacram. in genere)</hi> ſaith thus, <hi>Si quis dixerit, in Miniſtris dum Sacramenta conficiunt &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferunt, non requiri intentionem ſaltem faciendi quod facit Eccleſia, anathema ſit.</hi> i. e.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>If any one ſhall ſay, That there is not required in the Miniſters, whilst they make and confer the Sacraments, an Intention at leaſt of doing what the Church doth, let him be accurſed.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Thus have we ſeen what theſe two Councils have ſaid of the Point.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I am to ſhew in what Manner, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what Notion they require the Intention. And here I doubt not to affirm, That they require it as Neceſſary to the very Being of the Sacraments; inſomuch that though all the Externals, according to Chriſt's Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be exactly performed, yet there is a Nullity in them, if the Intention be a wanting. The Council of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> ſpeaks clearly enough to this purpoſe, making the Word, <hi>Perfected,</hi> equally reſpect Matter, Form and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention: And conſequently a Sacrament may as well
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50192:11"/>be perfected without Matter, or Form, as without the Intention: That is, Not at all. This the dulleſt eye may find by a review of the Citation.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. I confeſs, the <hi>Trent-Council</hi> only ſays, The Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is <hi>required,</hi> not adding How far, or in What man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, it is ſo: But that it means, required as <hi>neceſſary</hi> to the Being of the Sacraments, I prove by theſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. (1.) It will be granted me, that the two Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils determining or declaring the very ſame Article, muſt by their Words mean the very ſame thing. And Nature teaches me to make the more plain Unfolded Words of the former a Commentary upon the more general infolded Words of this. And then there can be no Orders or other Sacraments, where there is not the requir'd Intention.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. (2.) I prove it from the Stile of the <hi>Trent-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi> which makes the Word, <hi>[requiri] required,</hi> where-ever it is mentioned in her Canons, to ſignifie <hi>required as of neceſſity</hi> to the thing it is applied to. For inſtance, in the 14th. <hi>Seſſion,</hi> 9th. <hi>Canon. De Poen. Sacram.</hi> we read thus,— If any one ſhall ſay, That the Confeſſion of the Penitent <hi>[non requiri]</hi> is not <hi>required</hi> in Order to the Prieſt's Abſolving him, let him be accurſed.</p>
               <p>Again, in the 4th. <hi>Canon,</hi> thus, If any one ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that Contrition, Confeſſion, and Satisfaction <hi>[requiri]</hi> are <hi>required</hi> in the Penitent, as the matter of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Penance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> let him be accurſed. And ſo the Word is uſed elſewhere. And then the Senſe runs thus, As there can be no Abſolution without Confeſſion, ſo there can be no Sacrament without the Intention.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. (3.) I prove this from the <hi>Rubrics</hi> of the Maſs-Book of <hi>Pope Pius</hi> the V. corrected and ſet forth by the Decree of this very Council, <hi>De Defectibus circa Miſſam occurrentibus, Num.</hi> 1. Where we read, <hi>Quicquid ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum deficit, ſcil. Materia debita, Forma cum Intentione,

                  <p>Where any of theſe are wanting, <hi>viz.</hi> Due Matter, Form with the Intention, or Prieſtly Order in the Conſecrator, the Sacrament is not made up.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Note here. Although the Euchariſt only be ſpoken of in this Citation, yet by Parity of Ground, Orders, and the reſt are equally concerned, as to the Intention.

                     <hi>The Intention may two manner of ways be carried to</hi> ſome thing, <hi>either as to its Object, or to its Term or End. So the Intention of the Baptizer may be carried to the Act of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is to its Object, and ſo it is nothing elſe than to will the performance of that Act. It may be alſo carried to ſomething as its End,</hi> viz. <hi>to That for which he wills to Baptize; as to will that to be done, for which Baptiſm was inſtituted.</hi>

               <p>It is but making the caſe of Ordination parallel with the inſtance given of Baptiſm, and all will be clear. If a Biſhop purpoſe, will, or intend barely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the words your Church uſes in Ordaining Prieſts, <hi>viz.—Receive thou power to offer Sacrifice in the Church for the quick and dead, in the name of the Father, &amp;c.</hi> (which you make the form of that Sacrament) and to deliver to them the Paten with Bread, and the Chalice with Wine, (which you make the matter of it) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out going any farther: in this caſe the Intention is ſaid to be converſant about the Act. But if he alſo will or intend the Effect or End, to which the Sacramental Act is inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted as ſubſervient, he is ſaid to intend the Effect or End.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. The Firſt, for diſtinction ſake, is by good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors called the <hi>Exterior</hi> [outward] Intention, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the <hi>interior</hi> [inward] or Mental Intention. Which Terms I ſhall uſe in what follows, for ſaving a Circuit of Words. And for the ſame end I will call the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Matter and Form the Sacramental Act, or Action.</p>
               <p>Having ſaid this in a previous way, I come now to Anſwer your Queſtion, Whether your Councils re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſuch an Intention as is converſant about the Act, or End of the Sacraments.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. And I boldly affirm, 1. That it is not the Firſt only (if at all) which they require. 2. But that it is the latter.</p>
               <p>And I hold my ſelf concern'd to make ample and firm proof hereof, in regard all the inferences I am to make againſt you in this diſpute, will eſpecially lye upon theſe two grounds.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the Firſt, That it is not the Exterior Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion your Councils require by way of Decree or Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, I ſhall endeavour to prove by theſe Arguments,</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. (1.) This point is not proper matter for Councils to deal with. It is Matter of divine Faith, Worſhip,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50192:14"/>or Government that They (acting within their ſphear) are to debate upon, and Synodically to determine: and not Matter of common natural Knowledge, whereof the Heathen Philoſophers were as competent Judges as they. To an aſſent to Propoſitions of this (latter) kind, our judgments are to be wrought by the power and force of Reaſon: nor can our ignorance of them be conquered by any other weapons. This knowledge is not to be beaten into mens heads by bare Eccleſiaſtick affirmations and Anathema's. Nor did ever wiſe men take this courſe to do it. Well, The neceſſary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Intention, or Will, to all external Actions that are humane and free, is a point of mere natural Knowledge; it being in plain ſpeech nothing elſe but this, That a man willingly doth (acting humanely) the external actions he doth. Which <hi>[Velle]</hi> motion of the Will cannot be wanting to ſuch Actions, except in the caſe of Drunkenneſs or Frenzy, or ſomething elſe, which in like manner robs the Will of her Guide. Yea, it is ſuch a common Operation of the Will, we now ſpeak of, as no more concerns thoſe of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments than all other Actions in the World, that are hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and voluntary, whatever the Object, or End of them be. Thus when a man promiſeth a thing which at that time he reſolves never to perform, he yet intends to make that promiſe. When he threatens another only <hi>in terrorem,</hi> without purpoſing ever to execute that threat, he then intends to make that threat. And the Intention is ſo altogether preſuppoſed to outward Actions, that in common uſe of Speech we omit [ſay nothing of] it, in commanding, or forbidding, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing exterior Acts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We ſay, Read me a Chapter; make ready my Dinner, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without adding any thing more. For though theſe Actions now mentioned, are <hi>imperate</hi> Acts of the Will; that is, though the Will commands the inferiour powers to do them, as the hands
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50192:14"/>to act, and the Tongue to ſpeak, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet the Act of the Will [<hi>viz.</hi> the Intention,] is not ſo much as named when we ſpeak of ſuch Actions: and to do it would be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, inaſmuch as it is neceſſarily ſuppoſed to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them. All men take it for granted that men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to do, what they ſee them do in good Order. And this aſſurance is grounded on the mere Natural know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Nature of humane Acts, which are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called <hi>Voluntary,</hi> becauſe of the Will's Efficiency in them; or becauſe of their neceſſary dependence upon and connexion with the Elicite Acts of the Will.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. And in particular; for this Reaſon, Learned Men diſcourſing about our very Queſtion, make the Action of the Sacraments expreſs this intention, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out otherwiſe naming it; except upon ſome ſpecial oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. Dom. <hi>Soto</hi> ſpeaks plainly with a reſpect to this Point (in 4. <hi>Sent. Dist.</hi> 1. <hi>q.</hi> 5. <hi>art.</hi> 8.) <hi>Actus enim exterior &amp; volitio interior pro eodem reputantur.</hi> i. e.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>The exterior Act and the interior Volition [Act of the Will] are reputed for the ſame.</p>
               </q>
               <p>His meaning can be no other than this, The Outward Act is the Object of the Inward Act of the Will, and together with it doth compound or conſtitute one hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Action; and ſo may fitly denote the whole. Which is a very obvious Truth to all, whoſe thoughts have been any whit thinn'd and improv'd by Obſervation.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. Thus have I made it appear, That the Neceſſity of the Exterior Intention to all humane Acts (of which number are the Sacramental) falls under the Cogniſance of Natural Reaſon: And indeed it is ſuch Doctrine as hath been taught paſſing well in the Heathen Schools. Wherefore I conclude that your General Councils at <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Trent</hi> (which you muſt ſay knew and were mindful of their proper Province) did not gad ſo far out of their Way, as to determine and decree mere unrevealed Natural Points, ſuch as this we have in hand.</p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:50192:15"/>
               <p n="7">§. 7. To prevent miſtakes. I wot well there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Points of Natural Knowledg revealed in Scripture, which are therefore (by accident) become alſo Points of Faith: And that if theſe were denied by any Body of Chriſtian People, Councils might congruouſly declare them. But the Exteriour Intention is none of theſe; and my Argument reſpects only ſuch as this.</p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. I add, if your Councils might draw within their Sphear mere Points of Natural Knowledge, like this I have inſiſted on; <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Books might chance to be adopted into our Chriſtian Creed; which would look but odly. Could ſuch work rightly be done, it would be worth a Council's while to make a Compleat Courſe of Infallible Philoſophy, to ſave much pains and endleſs wrangling in your Schools. For if all ſuch things were once defined, a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick could no longer queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>
               <p n="9">§. 9. But this onely upon Suppoſition your Councils have defined the Intention to be neceſſary to humane Acts. I, for my part, clear them from any ſuch guilt. But if you do, Sir, What means your Queſtion?</p>
               <p n="10">§. 10. It appears alſo, That there is ſuch an evident dependence of the Sacramental, and all other humane Acts upon the Will or Intention, that no Man of Senſe ever did or can queſtion it: And therefore beſides that the work were improper for a Synod of Divines, it were altogether needleſs and fruitleſs to determine it: it were to act without a Motive, in my Opinion. Thoſe that would do This, might at the next ſtep, be expected to decree it Neceſſary, That all Lectors open their eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids when they read a Chapter; and that all Preachers open their Mouths when they exhort the People.</p>
               <p>Now, Sir, you muſt either joyn with me in loading your Councils with theſe abſurdities, or in concluding; That it is not the Exterior Intention which is the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their Decree and Canon.</p>

               <p n="11">§. 11. But whatever you do, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will befriend all I have ſaid on this Head.

               <q>
                  <p>We mean not that That is defined by the Council, which <hi>Catharinus</hi> means, and which <hi>Chemnitius</hi> would have; namely, that the Miniſter ſhould onely intend to do that Exterior Act which the Church doth: For there was No Need of defining That, in regard it hath never been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by any body, nor could be denied.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The Cardinal here declares, 1. That the Council [of <hi>Trent</hi>] did not define the Intention we now ſpeak of. 2. That they had no Motive to do it, foraſmuch as none ever did or could deny it. Whoſe Teſtimony ſhall ſhut up this Particular.</p>
               <p n="12">§. 12. (2.) I argue from the Nature of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie between <hi>Papist</hi> and <hi>Proteſtant</hi> about the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Which cannot reſpect it in the preſent Sence of the Word, there being no Proteſtant, that I ever read or heard of, who denies its neceſſity to the Act. None of us ever aſſerted that any Madman (as ſuch) was fit to manage any Civil Concern, much leſs Spiritual. In this caſe then, we could hardly contend, becauſe we concur in the Thing. Or at leaſt, it would follow, That the Learned men of both Parties quarrel not onely about Trifles, but about juſt Nothing. Which thing, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, a <hi>Romaniſt</hi> ſhould be unwilling to impute (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he judge of us) to the wiſeſt Men of his own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. Hence then I conclude, That it is a further Intention than this of the Act, which the <hi>Roman</hi> Church requires: And this breeds the Quarrel.</p>
               <p n="13">§. 13. After all this: Were it ſuppoſed that your Councils had ſtoop'd to that impertinent and needleſs
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50192:16"/>work of defining the Neceſſity of the Exterior Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; You are not a-whit the ſafer, except they had onely done that. Had they done that, and ſtopt there, we could not poſſibly have inferr'd from thence, That you were therefore uncertain of the Truth of your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments. But if they have required the Intention of the End, which lies not open to humane perception, you muſt ſtill be liable to my charge. And that it is ſuch a One which they require, I am to ſhew, in the next place.</p>

               <p n="3">§. 3. 2.

               <p>This Author divides this concluſion into parts, and preſents Arguments for the proof of them. But it would be ſuperfluous to tranſcribe the whole. He ſaith, the Intention to do the Act is neceſſary; but adds <hi>[non ſufficit]</hi> that it is not ſufficient. And the Reaſon he gives amounts to this, That though the Act of Baptiſm be done with Intention, yet in ſeveral caſes it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come fruitleſs and void [there may be no Baptiſm not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that Act] for want of another Intention, <hi>viz.</hi> that which reſpects the End.

                  <hi>It ſufficeth not that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter intends to Baptize, as that is a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Act; but as it is a Sign inſtituted to a certain End.</hi>

               <p n="14">§. 14. They generally put the Caſe, That the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Form [or Words] may be abuſed by Addition, Subſtraction, Tranſpoſition, and falſe Pronunciation; and upon This they put the Queſtion, Whether a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be perfected in ſuch caſes.

Their Argument lies thus, He that on purpoſe corrupts the Form may be judg'd not to intend to do what the Church doth; and without this Intention there is no true Sacrament. But then if the intention be right, the Sacred Work is perfected, notwithſtanding the 'fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid imperfections. The Act is here ſuppoſed to be the ſame, whether it happen to prove a Sacrament, or no; it is the Mental intention then that makes or marrs all. Which was the thing to be ſhew'd.</p>

               <p n="19">§. 19. <hi>In forma intelligitur verbum vocale;</hi> ſaith <hi>Sylveſt. (Verb. Bapt.) i. e.</hi> By the <hi>Form</hi> is underſtood the Word ſpoken.</p>

               <p>And then by proportion; By <hi>Matter</hi> muſt be meant Matter applyed. And this is ſuppoſed to be ſpoken and done with the Will or Intention. Now then when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all this, the Intention is added as a diſtinct thing, it muſt be interpreted of the <hi>interior</hi> Intention. The bright Words of <hi>Soto</hi> ſhall Seal up this,</p>
               <q>
                  <p n="20">§. 20. <hi>Si nulla eſſet intentio neceſſaria faciendi quod facit Eccleſia, vana eſſet aſſertio Doctorum &amp; Concilii Florentini, qua definitur requiri praeter Materiam &amp; Formam, Intentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem Miniſtri: Nam in hoc quod dicitur Materia &amp; Forma, intelligitur quod velit tam Materiam applicare quam for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam. Actus enim exterior &amp; Volitio interior pro eodem reputantur. Cum ergo inſuper addatur requiri intentionem, alia intentio intelligitur.</hi> i. e.</p>
                  <p>If the Intention of doing what the Church doth, was not neceſſary, the aſſertion of our Doctors and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Florence</hi> were vain, by which it is defined, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Matter and Form, the Intention of the Miniſter is required: For in the naming the Matter and Form, it is underſtood that he [the Miniſter] intends to apply both Matter and Form: For the exterior Act and the interior Intention [of doing that Act] are taken for the ſame Thing or Act. When therefore it is further added, That the Intention is required, another [Intention] is underſtood.</p>
               </q>
               <p n="21">§. 21. Thus, Sir, have I declared that the Intention your Councils require, is to be converſant about the End of the Sacraments; and ſhewed that the Stream of your Authors aſſiſt me with their Suffrage. If I err herein, they have led me out of the way: But then it is to your great harm, but not at all to mine. For if they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not what your Councils require, as Eſſential to the Sacraments in general, then they muſt be uncertain whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they have any true Sacrament; and in particular, whether they have that of Orders, and ſo any true Prieſts. How can you be certain you have enough, if you know
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50192:20"/>not what is enough? were this the caſe, my point is proved from your confeſs'd ignorance, as much as it could be from the moſt ſhining demonſtration.</p>
               <p n="22">§. 22. Indeed, Sir, I have been more luxuriant in my proof of the ſubject matter of this and the foregoing Section, for theſe two Reaſons: 1. To lay a ſure Ground for the deductions I hope to draw anon, to your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage. 2. To confront ſome falſe Aſſertions of a certain Prieſt of your Communion, made ſome time ago, to a perſon of Quality, who was concerned to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of him what the doctrin of the Intention amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to, as eſtabliſh'd by your Councils.</p>
               <p>He affirmed to the Lady, as I can ſhew under her well known hand, theſe three things:</p>
               <p n="23">§. 23. 1. That the Intention reſpected the Exterior Act only, ſaying, That it is impoſſible for a Prieſt that is in his right Wits, to perform the exterior Action re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, without Intending to do as he then doth.</p>
               <p>Now I have proved that there is required an Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the End, which confounds his falſe account of the matter.</p>
               <p n="24">§. 24. 2. He ſaid, The <hi>Roman</hi> Church never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the Doctrin of the Intention to be matter of Faith.</p>
               <p>But I have proved it to be One, if a Decree or Definition of ſuch Councils as the Body of <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks hold for General, can Oblige to Faith. And if theſe cannot do that, farewel Pope <hi>Pius</hi>'s Creed.</p>
               <p n="25">§. 25. 3. He only aſſigned this for the occaſion of the Councils medling with this matter, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſome held an Opinion that the Conſecrating and Conferring the Sacraments by madmen, who knew not what they were about, was valid.</p>
               <p>But I have ſhewed, that it is granted aforehand, That the Exterior Action ſhould be Humane, <hi>i. e.</hi> the iſſue of previous Knowledge; which a mad-man, <hi>as ſuch,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50192:20"/>exert. And I have alſo ſhewn that the Intention the Councils deal about, reaches farther, and is of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Nature. And ſo his frantick Story is void of Patronage.</p>
               <p n="26">§. 26. I confeſs School men, treating of their Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, put every Objection that can poſſibly come into their too fine ſpun thoughts; but if a man hatch from thence in his head ſwarms of Sectaries, that are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſeriouſly to embrace the matter of many of them, he can make them exiſt no where but in his fancy.</p>
               <p n="27">§. 27. And I doubt this is the caſe, when any one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports there were a Sect of people who held ſtark and ſtaring Mad men to be effectual Miniſters of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Authors do indeed ſpeak of Mad-men with a reſpect to our Caſe, and pronounce them unfit Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, becauſe they <hi>(as ſuch)</hi> cannot exert Humane Acts: but then their Argument amounts to this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Mad men cannot do the leſs, <hi>viz.</hi> Intend the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior Act, much leſs can they do the more, <hi>viz.</hi> Intend the End or Effect of an Inſtitution; which is required by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
               <p n="28">§. 28. I wiſh the Aſſertor would tell us, in what Age there were ſuch a Sect of men; in what Region they lived; who headed them; who began the Error; what Pens ſeriouſly defended it; what Biſhop excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated any man for holding it; or what Pope ſuſpended or deprived any Biſhop for embracing it. I would learn what Notoriety of Fact there was for theſe things, that it ſhould be worth a General Councils while to caſt an eye this way, and labour to ſtop the growing evil.</p>
               <p n="29">§. 29. I have read ſeveral Catalogues of Hereſies, ſome Ancient and ſome Modern, but I can find nothing like This amongſt them all.</p>
               <p>I wiſh my plain dealing with him, to which I have had more than ſufficient provocation, may whet him to the innocent revenge of making good againſt me (if
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50192:21"/>he can) his Affirmations above deſcribed. Till this be done, I ſhall conclude him either a moſt unlearned man; or one of a poor Spirit, who could find in his heart ſo to abuſe and impoſe upon a worthy Lady's want of skill in <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors and Councils.</p>
               <p>Sir, I acknowledge I have ſtept out of our way, a while, to ſalute a friend; but I do not deſire you to take any notice of that, unleſs you pleaſe. However, thoſe that are more concern'd, will do it; and ſubſcribe to the juſtice of my Viſit.</p>

                  <hi>SECT. VI.</hi> The End particularly conſidered is not required; but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally. The Virtual Intention is required, and held ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</head>
               <p>HAving already proved the Intention of the End to be required, I come now to view your next Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, whether that End be Proximate or Ultimate.</p>
               <p n="1">§. 1. And I muſt ſay, I ſee not what Reaſon you have to ask this Queſtion here, the matter of it having no neceſſary influence upon the ſubject of our debate. For if it be the End, however conſider'd, whether confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly and in general, or diſtinctly and in ſpecial; it is alike out of the compaſs of the Inſpection of others, which is the formal Ground I argue from, to your Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of having a true Prieſthood or any Sacraments at all.</p>
               <p>I ſay, if it be the End more generally conſider'd, <hi>ex gr.</hi> to do an Action as Sacred, as Relative to an Inſtitution, as a Mean to this or that indefinite End; all this comes to one, with a reſpect to my deſign.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. Nevertheleſs, I ſhall chearfully go ſome paces (though upon a needleſs Errand) which way you ſhall pleaſe to drive me. I affirm then, Your Councils and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50192:21"/>Doctors require not the intending any End, thus, or ſo diſtinctly conſidered or ſpecified; but as ſomething in general, which Chriſt and the Church; or, Chriſt or the Church intends to do by the inſtituted Action.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. This <hi>ſomething</hi> is (it ſeems) ſufficient to the Sacraments, although very hardly, as we may learn from the words of the <hi>Trent</hi>-Council, which I ſhall here repeat, <hi>There is required of the Miniſters of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments an Intention of doing, at leaſt, what the Church doth.</hi> The <hi>ſaltem</hi> [at leaſt] ſounds, to me, a poor word, where a dogmatical Article is defined: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I muſt take it as it is, and ſhall explain the matter briefly from your Authors.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. After G. <hi>Biel</hi> had told us (as is aforeſaid) That the Miniſters are required to will that to be done, for which the Sacrament was inſtituted; he immediately adds,</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Et haec Intentio eſt duplex, <hi>ſcil.</hi> ſpecialis, quâ intendit ut Baptizatus fiat filius Regni; qui eſt finis remotus: vel propinquus, qui eſt remiſſio peccati Originalis &amp; Gratiae in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſio; aut quod fiat Chritianus &amp; membrum Eccleſiae mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantis: vel generalis, ut fiat quod Eccleſiae intendit, licet non cogitetur aut ignoretur vel etiam non credatur id conferri per baptiſmum quod Eccleſia intendit, <hi>i. e.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this Intention is twofold, <hi>viz.</hi> Special, whereby he intends that the baptized perſon may attain Salvation; which is the remote End; or that he obtain the pardon of Original Sin and the infuſion of Grace; or that he be made a Chriſtian or a Member of the Church Militant; which is the proximate End of it. Or it is general, <hi>viz.</hi> that That may be done which the Church intends, althogh it be not conſidered, nor underſtood, or not believed that That is conferred by Baptiſm which the Church intends.</p>
               </q>
               <p>We ſee here, it is a very general and indiſtinct End that is ſet forth by theſe words, <hi>what the Church intends or doth.</hi> And our Author goes on to reach our point in his third Concluſion.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>To the truth of the Sacrament there is not required ſuch an Intention of the Miniſter as reſpects the effect of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm in ſpecial: but it ſuffices to intend what the Church intends in the general.</p>

Which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly jumps with the ſenſe of the <hi>Trent</hi> definition. But I need cite no more for This, the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors being generally of the ſame mind.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. You ask again, Whether the Intention required, he Habitual, Vertual, or Actual.

But the Vertual is neceſſary to the Sacraments.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7.

                  <hi>SECT. VII. Roman</hi> Catholicks not certain of their Prieſthood taken in general by any ſimple or abſolute Certainty. Nor certain of it taken in ſpecial by any ſimple, or ſo much as a Moral Certainty.</head>
               <p>YOur laſt Queſtion is, What certainty I ſpeak of in my Propoſitions, (when I deny the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to be certain She hath any true Prieſthood) whether it be Moral, Metaphyſical, or Mathematical.</p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:50192:23"/>
               <p n="1">§. 1. Here I muſt premiſe a diſtinction in Order to the clear reſolution of your Queſtion. Your Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood may be conſidered either confuſedly and in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as inherent or exiſting in ſome perſons of your Church indeterminately conſider'd; as if it were ſaid, there are in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church ſome true Prieſts, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be not known that This or That individual perſon be ſuch a one: Or diſtinctly and in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, as inherent in Theſe or Thoſe perſons deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minately conſidered, whoſe names may be told, or their perſons mark'd or pointed out. As if it were ſaid, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>A.</hi> or <hi>B.</hi> is a true Prieſt.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. Now for Anſwer: I deny the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is ſimply or abſolutely certain that ſhe hath any true Prieſthood, in the firſt ſenſe. The Propoſition is not evident by its own light to all that underſtand the Terms; and therefore I deny that you have for it the certainty of Intelligence: which is all one, I ſuppoſe, with that you call Metaphyſical certainty. Nor is it any Concluſion evidently deduced from firſt Principles, and therefore I deny that you have for it the certainty of Science: which is the ſame, I ſuppoſe, that you call Mathematical certainty. If you make good your Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood either of theſe ways, our underſtandings could not reſiſt the evidence preſented, inaſmuch as the Reaſon of our aſſent to firſt Principles is the clear immediate connexion of the Terms; and the Reaſon of our aſſent to Scientifical Concluſions is the clear connexion of the Terms with an evident Medium. But your men never pretended to prove this point either of theſe ways, that I have heard of: nor would I have ſaid one word of this kind, had not the Terms of your Queſtion offered me the occaſion. However, to accommodate my ſelf to your thoughts ſo far as I can, I will ſuppoſe, You meant not to uſe thoſe words, <hi>Mathematical</hi> and <hi>Metaphyſical,</hi> in a proper ſenſe; but only in an alluſive way to denote
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50192:23"/>by them a ſimple Certainty, equal to that of Intelligence or Science, which you ſuppoſe to ſpring from a diverſe root, <hi>viz.</hi> Divine Revelation. But then I muſt anſwer on, as I have begun, by denying that you have any Certainty of Faith for the Matter.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. For the Propoſition taken in the ſecond Senſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That you have any Perſons in your Church deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minately or ſingularly conſidered, as Father <hi>A.</hi> or <hi>B.</hi> who are true Prieſts; I deny that you have for it either the abſolute and infallible Certainty of <hi>Faith,</hi> or ſo much as a <hi>Moral</hi> Certainty, properly ſo called.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. And here it will be as needful a piece of work, as any I have yet done, to prepare the Reader for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a ſure judgment of what ſhall follow, to open the Nature of Moral Certainty. And becauſe your Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors are ſufficiently agreed about it, it will not matter much, which of them I call forth to deſcribe it. Let <hi>Cardinal Bellarmine</hi> be the Man, who ſets forth the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter very diſtinctly (<hi>Le juſtif. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 2.) He then (as others do) having divided Certainty into <hi>Evident,</hi> and <hi>Obſcure</hi> Certainty, aſſigns three degrees to both of them. Of the <hi>Evident</hi> he gives the firſt degree to firſt Principles, the ſecond to Science, the third to Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Of <hi>Obſcure</hi> Certainty he gives the firſt degree to Divine Faith, the ſecond to Humane Faith, the third to Opinion.</p>
               <p>Having ſaid this in a previous way, I ſhall now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce what he ſays touching Moral Certainty. <hi>Secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum gradum,</hi> &amp;c. <q>
                     <hi>Thoſe things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>obtain the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond degree of Obſcure Certainty, which are believed for the ſake of Humane Authority, but ſo confirmed and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated a One,</hi> [ut omnem formidinem prorſus excludat] <hi>that it altogether excludes all fear. Such as are theſe, That</hi> Cicero <hi>and</hi> Virgil <hi>were famous Men: that</hi> Auguſtus <hi>go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned a great part of the World happily: that there are many famous Cities in Provinces at a great distance from
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50192:24"/>us, as</hi> Alexandria <hi>in</hi> Egypt, Conſtantinople <hi>in</hi> Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia, Jeruſalem <hi>in</hi> Paleſtine, Antioch <hi>in</hi> Aſia. <hi>And this is called the Certainty of Humane Faith, or Moral Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty; which although it be not ſo great, that it can be no way falſe, (for every Man is a Liar) yet it is ſo great, that he may deſervedly be judged temerarious, who thinks or diſputes against it.</hi>
                  </q> Thus <hi>Bellarmine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. Hence it is obvious to collect, 1. That Moral Certainty is the experimental knowledge of others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to us by due Teſtimony. 2. That this Certainty bred from the Evidence of the Motives (I ſay not of the Object) that cauſe our aſſent, ſo far fills the Mind with tranquillity and ſecurity, that there is no place left for rational doubts or fears, leſt our conceptions ſhould not be anſwerable to their Objects. And truly when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon my belief in this kind, and the grounds of it, (and fear can only ariſe that way) I find my ſelf no more tempted to doubt, whether there hath been ſuch a City as <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in <hi>Thracia,</hi> which I have never ſeen, than I am whether there hath been ſuch a City as <hi>Lisbone</hi> in <hi>Portugal,</hi> which I have ſeen. Though it be not repugnant to the Nature of Man to be deceived, and to deceive; yet how ſuch Multitudes of Men of ſeveral ranks, qualifications and Countries, ſhould be deceived in a moſt ſenſible Object; or conſpire to deliver a falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood for truth, eſpecially when by the report they could not hope to reap to themſelves any poſſible advantage, (this, I ſay) is ſo utterly unperceivable by any regular Thoughts, that he may well be deem'd to want the uſe of his reaſon, who is afraid of being deceived in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that there hath been ſuch a place as <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> upon ſo credible Teſtimony. The bare poſſibility of a thing's being otherwiſe than we judge it to be, (when the exacteſt diſquiſition can make no more of it) ſo little affects the Mind, that I have not ſo much as the Shadow and Figure of fear, leſt there ſhould not be ſuch a place as <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:50192:24"/>
               <p>I know indeed there may be ſome degrees of Moral Certainty proportion'd to the Motives or Mediums that beget it; but yet it belongs to the Nature of it in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, firmly to adhere to its Object, from the perception of truth and conviction of the Mind, ſo far that it is not in our power, acting reaſonably, to diſſent from it, or to fear that we judge amiſs.</p>

                  <q>Thoſe things <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> have a third degree of Certainty, which rest on ſo many ſigns and conjectures, as render a Man ſecure and exclude anxiety, <hi>[non tamen formidinem omnem ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellunt]</hi> but yet expel not all fear; and this is called con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectural Certainty, and rather belongs to Opinion than Faith.</q> 
                  <hi>Thus he.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. Now by comparing Moral and Conjectural Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, according to their Deſcriptions newly given, we find a conſiderable difference between them. The firſt ſhuts out fear, as being the reſult of a brighter Motive; the latter lets in fear through the in-evidence of its Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium. The firſt is a firm adherence to a Thing as true, the latter is an infirm adherence to a Thing as likely to be true. And therefore the firſt deſerves the Name of Certainty, but the latter is abuſively ſo called. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Cardinal ſeeing what he calls <hi>Conjectural</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, unworthy to ſtands upon the ſame level with <hi>Moral,</hi> reaſonably thruſts it down into an inferiour Place.</p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. I know indeed that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and his Followers, ſpeaking as Natural Philoſophers, make not Humane Faith [or Moral Certainty] a Middle thing, nor place it in a diſtinct Claſſe, between Science and Opinion: But the Reaſon of that is, it was not their deſign to make any exact compariſon of the greater or leſs ſtrength
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50192:25"/>or weakneſs of Aſſents to particular contingent things, and to give them diſtinct Seats, accordingly; but to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them in a lump with Science; and to ſhew, That the higheſt Aſſent below That, may poſſibly be falſe. And ſo they leave theſe two lapt up in a Bundel without diſtinction, under the Name of Opinion. But thoſe that ſpeak of them, as Moral Philoſophers do very manifeſtly, and upon good Cauſe diſtinguiſh them, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath here done; making Moral Certainty to exclude fear, and Opinion to admit it. And none can queſtion, but when there is foundation for them in the Nature of things, diſtinctions are to be allowed.</p>
               <p n="9">§. 9. But if any liſt to retain the former way of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it will come to the ſame; provided we thus diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of Opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> Opinion is either moſt vehement and intenſe, ſuch as, Morally ſpeaking, excludes all fear; Or light and weak, which neceſſarily gives way to fear: And provided we make Moral Certainty the ſame thing with the firſt Member of this diſtinction: Men may be allowed to uſe what words they pleaſe in Polemical Diſcourſes, ſuppoſing we underſtand what they mean by them.</p>
               <p>Thus, Sir, have I diſpatcht the Explication of thoſe Terms that you called for, and of ſome others which might puzzle ſome Readers, unleſs they were attended with ſuch help. This work I thought I was obliged to extend to an unuſual length for theſe Reaſons, (menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned before) 1. To enable the more unlearned to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come competent Judges of the ſtrength of my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or your Anſwers to them. 2. To ſave my ſelf much poſſible trouble of Papers, which might be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied upon Occaſion of a few Words left in ambiguity and darkneſs. When men are once ingaged in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, we find by daily Experience a ſmall matter ſerves almoſt endleſly to keep them doing, to the loſs of their time, and diſquiet of their Perſons. 3. I add, our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putative
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50192:25"/>part will look clearer, when we need not blend it with requiring and giving any explanation of words.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe what I have done in this kind lies ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the ſeveral Sections, I ſhall gather them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in brief, preſent them at once to your view, in the following Section.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>SECT. VIII.</hi> The ſeveral Explications before given, Summ'd up. And the Queſtion reſolved into its Parts.</head>
               <p n="1">1. I Have declared, That your Councils require the Miniſter's Intention, as neceſſary to the Being of a Sacrament. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Intention they require, is not that of the Outward Act, (its preſence to the Act being preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.) <hi>Sect.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But it is That of the End or Effects. <hi>Sect.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That it is not neceſſary to Intend the End diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered, as Proximate or Ultimate, but as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in general, which relates to Chriſt's Inſtitution, or the Appointment or Practice of the Church, or the like. <hi>Sect.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That a Virtual Intention is Neceſſary and Suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. <hi>Sect.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>Your Senſe of the Terms muſt (as was ſaid before) be mine: And that I have truly repreſented your Senſe, your Authors already produced, or referred to, will amount to a full Certificate. They will ſecure me upon the Suppoſition made, that the Doctrine of your Councils is capable of being underſtood, at leaſt by the leading Members of your own Church. If it be not, you mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie thoſe your Councils without Reaſon, which either could not ſpeak intelligibly, or for ſome odd Ends ſeemed to define Faith, when they did Nothing.</p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:50192:26"/>
               <p n="6">6. I deny that your Prieſthood taken Indeterminately or in general, doth (in an Ordinary way, or without Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Revelation) admit the infallible Certainty of Divine Faith: Or that taken determinately, or in particular, it admits either the aforeſaid Certainty of Faith, or an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental, or yet a Moral Certainty properly ſo called.</p>
               <p n="1">§. 1. By certainty, I ſtill mean an Intellectual certainty, ſuch as is conſentaneous to its Object, which is the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Foundation of it.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being thus ſet in open view, it will be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily apprehended, That our Queſtion is a Complex Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and is reſolvable into two ſimple ones; which as they are ſtated, will ſtand thus,</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. 1. Whether the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, which makes Prieſtly Orders neceſſarily depend upon the Ordaining Biſhops (at leaſt) Virtual Intention of the End of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, can be certain with an abſolute or infallible Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Faith, that they have ſome true Prieſts, in general.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. 2. Whether that Church—can be certain with the aforeſaid Certainty of Faith; or with a Moral Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty; That they have This or That true Prieſt in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
               <p>Now I deny to your Church the fore-named reſpective Certainties of their having a true Prieſthood, in either Senſe: and which is more, have taken upon me to prove the Negative, a task I cannot complain of, (though it be not very natural) becauſe I was, for once, content to take it upon my ſelf.</p>
               <p>Pray mark, That I moreover deny a Theological Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of your Prieſthood taken in either of the Senſes of it above-mentioned. <hi>That is,</hi> I deny that it can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded either from two Revealed Propoſitions, or from one Revealed and another Evident by the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s Silence of it tempted me to omit it in the laſt Section.</p>

               <p>HAVING finiſht the Explications required of me, in a far other and ampler manner than was required, and whatever elſe I thought uſeful in a previous way, for the clearer ſight of the point in queſtion; I ſhall now declare in what general Order I purpoſe to proceed.</p>
               <p n="1">§. 1. 1. I ſhall evince by managing the Medium already exhibited, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is uncertain of their having any Prieſthood; as Prieſthood is taken <hi>determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately,</hi> or (as I may ſay) <hi>in the parcels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the only thing I formerly ſtood upon, when I had occaſion in a very ſhort Paper (a ſingle Folio page) to expoſe the Evils incident to <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks from their doctrine of the Intention. Let me ſay, by the way, I mean that Paper, to which one of your Prieſts told me in your hearing, he had ſome years ago ſeen an Anſwer.

               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:50192:27"/>
               <p>And this was the only thing I intended to do at the firſt ſtarting of the Argument with you; as knowing it would enable me (when made good) to load you ſufficiently with unwelcome conſequences; and to ſet That in the light, which it would be your intereſt to keep in darkneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. 2. I ſhall conſider a little (beyond my firſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) how far your Prieſthood taken <hi>indeterminately,</hi> and (as I may ſay) <hi>in the groſs,</hi> will follow the fate of the other.</p>
               <p>This being ſaid, I come to produce your Letter pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting an Anſwer to my Argument, and to examine its force. If I find my ſelf ſo bridled up by it that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not run my deſigned courſe, I will acknowledge the power of your Curb: but if not, I ſurely go forward to your loſs.</p>

                     <p>Sir, It was alledged to you that the Orders of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church had been by <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks judged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valid by reaſon of your altering the Form of Ordination, and ſufficient diſcovering your. Intention not to do as the Church doth in that Sacrament. And your way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending your Ordination ſeemed to me very ſtrange, when you retorted in this manner: <hi>I deny,</hi> ſay you, <hi>that the</hi> Roman <hi>Church is certain that ſhe hath any Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood or Sacraments according to her own Principles, and I oblige my ſelf to deal with Mr.</hi> Goodall <hi>about this point. Witneſs my hand,</hi> Thomas Marſden. <hi>I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted and ſubſcribed,</hi> Edward. Goodall. For when you <hi>deny that we are certain that we have any Prieſthood according to our own Principles;</hi> it were but reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for you to expect of us, that we ſhould be uncertain at leaſt, that you have any, ſince you ſo earneſtly contend to derive your Succeſſion and Orders from us, [See for this
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50192:27"/>

                  <head>The Examination of it follows.</head>
                  <p>Sir, Although the Prefatory part of your Letter here recited, does not at all affect my Argument by way of Anſwer, and ſo without any prejudice might be paſſed by without regard; yet on other accounts I find it my concern to diſſect it, and to expoſe its putrid parts.</p>
                  <p n="3">§. 3. You then undertake two things in it, 1. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late ſome matters of Fact which paſſed between you and me. 2. To inſinuate ſome diſadvantages incurred on my part, through (at leaſt) an unwary manage of things. Both theſe ſhall be inſpected.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt: Your Relation of Fact contains two things;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Your charging the Church of <hi>England</hi> with the invalidity of her Orders, both becauſe we had altered the Form of Ordination, and alſo diſcovered our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention not to do as the Church doth, in that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <hi>as you term it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. My attempt to diſcharge her by denying the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church to be certain, that ſhe hath a true Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood or Sacraments, according to her own principles;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50192:28"/>and obliging my ſelf to deal with you on that Head. This is what you declare for Fact.</p>
                  <p>Now I confeſs, were the caſe exactly ſuch as you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent it, I made but a very weak defence of <hi>our</hi> Church, how freely ſoever I might ſtrike at <hi>yours.</hi> To argue that my Coin is current, becauſe my Neighbour cannot prove his to be ſo, would be very inconcluding. But what would not a man give for Faith in a Hiſtorian!</p>
                  <p n="4">§. 4. Sir, You have ſaid both too little, and too much, concerning your ſelf and me.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Too little.</hi> For when you affirmed our Orders to be <hi>invalid in the judgment of</hi> Roman <hi>Catholicks,</hi> I juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied them by thoſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church unto which our firſt Reformers were admitted. And when you ſaid the Nullity of our Orders proceeded from our forſaking the old Ordinal, and from our giving power to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained <hi>only</hi> to <hi>diſpenſe</hi> the Word and Sacraments, which, <hi>ſaid you,</hi> any Deacon might do; I ſhewed how you miſtook the thing by taking the word <hi>diſpenſe</hi> in too narrow a ſenſe, whereas it comprehends the whole duty of Goſpel-Miniſters; and therefore the alteration was only <hi>verbal</hi> and not <hi>real.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Fact I have ſet forth more particularly, <hi>Part I. Sect.</hi> 1. whither I refer the Reader.</p>
                  <p>This, Sir, was a direct Anſwer to your Objection, and conſequently a perfect deſence of our Prieſthood againſt your aſſault.</p>
                  <p>Now I am ſorry you ſhould conceal not only the forenamed Relation I made to your Orders, but alſo the Inſtance you gave, and my Anſwer to it, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe (as much as I can gather from your words) to make people believe I had nothing at all to ſay in behalf of our Miniſtry, but deſerted it at firſt view of your wretched Objection, and requited you with a bare Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimination: Nay, which is yet more groſs, that I uſed <hi>that</hi> as a Medium, and my only Medium for the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50192:28"/>Vindication of our Church. Your own Conſcience, beſides the Teſtimony of our Auditors, (who were no Children,) can aſſure you that ſuch was the Matter of your Objection, and ſuch the Matter of my Anſwer, as is ſet down before.</p>
                  <p n="5">§. 5. 2. You have ſaid <hi>too much,</hi> in reporting that to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validate our Orders, you urged <hi>our ſufficient diſcovery of our Intention not to do as the Church doth.</hi> This, Sir, I am obliged to call pure fiction, no ſuch words being named but by me upon the Queſtion now in hand, after our ſlight skirmiſhes concerning the other were ended.</p>
                  <p>I could make your own Authors ridicule you about the very matter of your charge, but I forbear leſt you ſhould take ſome light occaſion from it to deſert your leſs grateful POST. What I quarrel is only your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port: and truly I would hope that ſome cares or troubles had blended your thoughts when you writ theſe things, being loth to think there was much of Will in theſe Errors. However, I would as a friend adviſe you to be cautious hereafter, of treating even your enemies at ſuch a rate.</p>
                  <p n="6">§. 6. For the Second, <hi>viz.</hi> the diſadvantages you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe me to ly under by ſome unlucky or unadviſed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings on my part. (I know not well how to word it.)</p>
                  <p n="7">§. 7. The firſt (reputed) diſadvantage is my ſtrange way of defending <hi>our</hi> Church by taxing <hi>yours.</hi> Anſwer, This is waſht off already by detecting (to ſpeak ſoftly) your partial Relation of Fact.</p>
                  <p>The Second is, If we make you Uncertain of your own Prieſthood, you muſt be ſuppoſed to be, at leaſt, Uncertain of Ours, who contend to derive our Orders and Succeſſion from you.</p>
                  <p n="8">§. 8. Anſwer, 1. Pray, What mortal harm is this to us, who reſt not for any thing of moment upon the <hi>ſole</hi> judgment of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church? 2. For our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving our Orders from you, we mean only this by it,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50192:29"/>that our firſt Reformers received their Orders from Chriſt by the Miniſtry of ſuch <hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhops as were in Communion with the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; and theſe conſidered onely as Chriſtian Biſhops. Which ſurely might be done, and yet you may have embraced a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which till you diſcard it, will render you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain that you <hi>have,</hi> and conſequently <hi>convey</hi> true Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. And whether <hi>that</hi> of the Intention be not ſuch is to be the matter of the approaching tug between us, and therefore is to be referred to its proper place. 3. Your <hi>Nihil dat quod in ſe non habet,</hi> ſeems quite beſides our buſineſs; which is not to ſcan whether you <hi>have none,</hi> but whether you are uncertain of your having any Prieſthood. You may <hi>have</hi> and <hi>give,</hi> without being certain of either, whilſt you hold to the Doctrine of the Intention.</p>
                  <p>The third is, Though we pretend you to be Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <hi>yet for your Comfort, We are certain enough of the truth of your Prieſthood, and therefore never reordain,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="9">§. 9. Anſwer. You are, it ſeems, grown wonderful kind upon a ſudden, in granting us <hi>to be certain enough of the truth of your Prieſthood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To be <hi>certain,</hi> is a great Word: <hi>Certain enough,</hi> a greater: And your Prieſthood is a great Matter to be certain of. You puzzle me to think How this ſhould be: For your great Writers allow not us (you call He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks) to underſtand Scripture, or Fathers, or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, but appropriate all this to the Sons of your Church. And then what Way is there left for us to arrive at this Certainty? But I will take your Word for it, and deſire you to remember againſt another time, that Proteſtants (whilſt ſuch) may be certain of Matters of no ſmall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Religion. But I ſhould not, I think, build too much upon this conceſſion, becauſe I have ſometimes found a trick in things of this kind, <hi>viz.</hi> Our judgment is good when we declare any thing in your Favour: But
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50192:29"/>when we charge you (to the beſt of our judgments) with any Errours, We are very Idiots.</p>
                  <p n="10">§. 10. This is ſurprizing alſo, that you build Comfort upon <hi>our</hi> Certainty of <hi>your</hi> Prieſthood. I had thought <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks were ſo top ful of Comfort from their <hi>own</hi> Grounds, that there was no room left for <hi>our</hi> ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, but you have undeceived me here; We add, it ſeems, to your ſtock. Comfort is a precious thing; and you ought henceforth, inſtead of counting us a mere Offence to you, to acknowledge us for your Benefactors.</p>
                  <p n="11">§. 11. But heark you. If we be certain of the Thing (which you grant) and you chance to be uncertain, how redound this to our diſadvantage, unleſs our perfection be reckoned againſt us as a Crime? Or, what is the Reaſon of your mentioning our Certainty here? Is it, that if we be certain, you muſt be ſo too?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Non ſequitur.</hi> If one Man ſo hoodwink himſelf that he cannot rightly diſtinguiſh Objects relating either to himſelf or others, may not he yet <hi>do both,</hi> who keeps the muffle off his face. This is the caſe, You are hoodwink'd with the Doctrine of Intention (as will be found anon) but we are not ſo: And till you put <hi>that</hi> off, you will not be able to ſee any one man in your Church to be a true Prieſt. And, by the way, if you put off That, you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all put off your (pretended) Infallibility.</p>
                  <p>The Fourth is, That my Words are very Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, when I ſay, I deny the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to be certain that She <hi>hath any Prieſthood or Sacraments,</hi> according to her own Principles.</p>
                  <p n="12">§. 12. The Extraordinary words you refer to, if I may gueſs by the ſcore of your Pen under them, (to expreſs which, I have put them in a different Character) are theſe,— <hi>any Prieſthood or Sacraments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Anſwer. The words are ordinary, that is, in fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar uſe, taken ſingle, or apart; and in their Contexture they are not otherwiſe, unleſs they give impertinent
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50192:30"/>Senſe or Nonſenſe. But till you be at leiſure to make this appear, I ſhall not be at leiſure to frame an Apology.</p>
                  <p n="13">§. 13. But you may perhaps think it extraordinary, that I deny you to be certain— <hi>according to your own Principles,</hi> and may have put your <hi>lineal Mark</hi> under the foregoing Words by miſtake. For I perceive, that for ſome reaſon or other, you afterwards give me a <hi>Memento</hi> concerning them. If it chance to be ſo, (for that I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is but a ſmall Error) I ſhall return a few words to it:</p>
                  <p>Had I made a Doctrine common to you and us the Baſis of my Argument, though my manifeſt Inferences from it muſt have bound you, yet I could not properly have called this <hi>Arguing from your own Principles:</hi> But if I prove the undertaken Concluſion from a peculiar Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of your own, viz. <hi>that of the Intention;</hi> then you are uncertain that you have a Prieſthood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your Principles; foraſmuch as a Concluſion evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently deduced is the genuine iſſue of its Principles or Premiſſes, and virtually contained in them.</p>

                              <hi>All Churches,</hi> ſay you, <hi>that make Prieſtly Ordination depend upon a Condition, which no Man living knows, whether it be fulfill'd, must be uncertain whether they have any true Prieſthood.

                           </p>
                           <p>You endeavour to prove your Minor Propoſition af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Manner,</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>The Intention of the Priest is a Condition,</hi> ſay you, <hi>which no Man living knows, whether it be fulfill'd or no in Ordination. But the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>requires the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Biſhop to Ordination.</hi> Ergo,</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>The Church of</hi> Rome <hi>requires a Condition in Ordination, which no Man living knows, whether it be fulfill'd or No.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I admit of the following Interpretation, wherein you ſay, <hi>That by every Man living you mean all Perſons contradiſtinguiſhed to the Ordaining Biſhops.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>In anſwer to your Syllogiſms or forms of Argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, you muſt give me leave firſt to diſtinguiſh in the major Propoſition of the former, between that Knowledge which is obtained by the Obſervation of the exterior Actions and Geſtures, and attention to the Words of the Prelates in any particular Ordinations; and that knowledge we have from the conſideration of the Nature and End of Ordination in general, and which is alſo neceſſarily deduced from other known Principles of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Church grounded upon Divine Revelation.</p>
                           <p>Firſt then, if you underſtand by <hi>knowing</hi> here know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the former way onely, which you ſeem to me to do, I deny this your firſt Propoſition to be true. For ſuppoſing (not granting) that the <hi>Roman Catholick Church doth make Prieſtly Ordination to depend upon a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that no Man living, contradiſtinguiſhed from the Ordaining Biſhop, knows,</hi> in the former way (<hi>viz.</hi> by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving only what is outwardly done, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) <hi>Whether it
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50192:31"/>be fulfilled or no,</hi> yet it doth not follow that ſhe <hi>muſt be uncertain whether ſhe have any true Prieſthood:</hi> Becauſe others, beſides the Ordaining Prelates, know, that ſhe hath true Prieſthood by the ſecond way of knowledge above-mentioned, that is, from the nature and end of the thing, and neceſſary deduction from other true Principles: For they know, as to the nature of the thing, that it is <hi>Morally impoſſible</hi> that all the Prelates in the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Church ſhould be ſo <hi>Malicious,</hi> as wilfully to have omitted any thing in Ordination, which they believed to be eſſential to it, and which the Church requires as ſo, ſuppoſing it poſſible for them to do it, and not be diſcovered. It is impoſſible for us to believe, according to our Principles, that they ſhould all turn Devils, and conſpire, as much as in them lies, to damn the whole Church in their time, and all ſucceeding Ages, when withal they could propoſe no advantage at all to themſelves by this, but the clean contrary. Again, <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks hold this as a Principle, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is but one Holy, Catholick, Apoſtolick Church, and that <hi>This,</hi> in the Communion of which they live, is It; and that God will preſerve and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue this Church to the Worlds end, and all this from Divine Revelation.</p>
                           <p>Now they are not ſo dull therefore, as not to be able to conclude neceſſarily from hence, that they muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways have a true Prieſthood: For the Means is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the end. Therefore whatſoever Intention of the Prelates is by them believed, as neceſſary for this end, they do certainly believe according to their Principles, that God's Providence will ſecure it. His Omnipotence is able to make good his Fidelity. Remember now that you are arguing with <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, <hi>according to their own Principles,</hi> and theſe laſt mentioned are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſo.</p>
                           <p>Thus I have ſhewed the firſt Propoſition in your firſt
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50192:31"/>Syllogiſin to be falſe, though upon it your whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentation depends. Secondly, If you mean by <hi>Knowing</hi> that way of Knowledge which is thus neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily deduced from Principles, and the Nature and End of Ordination, then for the laſt mentioned Reaſon, the <hi>Minor</hi> of your former Syllogiſm, and the <hi>Major</hi> of your latter are both falſe. For the <hi>Roman</hi> Church doth not make Prieſtly Ordination depend upon a Condition which no man living beſides the Ordaining Biſhops know, (<hi>viz.</hi> in the way of knowledge laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) whether it be fulfill'd. And the Intention of the Ordaining Biſhop is not a Condition, which no man, beſides himſelf, thus knows to be fulfill'd. If you underſtand the word <hi>knows</hi> in one of theſe ſenſes in your firſt Propoſition, and in another in your fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, then your Syllogiſm is vicious, becauſe it hath four terms.</p>
                           <p>My Anſwer will be made more clear by an Inſtance which I ſhall uſe by way of Retort upon your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. You take it for a Principle amongſt you, That there is a certain number of thoſe that are truly elected to Salvation, in your Communion. And you will allow this alſo as a principle that theſe Elect muſt have true ſaving Grace in their hearts, as a condition neceſſary to their Salvation; which ſaving Grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you do not know to be in any particular man, therefore you cannot be certain that he is one of thoſe that is Elected to Salvation: yet you would ſay that the man were a very bad Logician, and <hi>maliciouſly</hi> bent againſt you that ſhould thus argue: That Church which makes Salvation depend upon a Condition, which no man living knows whether it be fulfil'd in order to Salvation, muſt be uncertain whether they have any who ſhall be ſaved in their Communion. But the <hi>Engliſh</hi> doth ſo. <hi>Ergo,</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church is uncertain whether they have any which ſhall be ſaved in their Communion.</p>
                           <pb n="54" facs="tcp:50192:32"/>
                           <p>True Grace in the heart is a condition which no man living knows whether it be fulfill'd or no in order to Salvation. But the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church requires true Grace in the heart in order to Salvation. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church requires a Condition in order to Salvation which no man living knows whether it be fulfill'd or no. For you will ſay that in the general way of knowledge beforementioned you know certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that this Condition is fulfill'd, though you know it not as to particulars. The Argument may be thus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to any Chriſtian Church in the world, or to all of them together; but you ſee it is vicious upon the ſame reaſon that I have alledged againſt yours, as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt: Therefore ſo is yours too. I deſire you alſo to take notice here, that I do not deny that the Intention of the Ordaining Prelate may be ſufficiently known in both the ways of Knowledge abovementioned, which will make the caſe different from the inſtance but now brought. But it is enough for the preſent that I have fully anſwer'd your Argument.</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Have done you juſtice in truly exhibiting your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and have preſented it at once, as it lies in your Paper, to the Readers view; leſt if I had given it in parcels, and interpoſed my Reflections by the way, it might have been ſaid, I had robb'd it of ſomewhat of its beauty or ſtrength by breaking its face or dependance. The ſum of it (to my underſtanding) comes to this,</p>
               <p n="1">§. 1. The Ordaining Biſhop's Intention is knowable either by the obſervation of his doing the Exterior Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50192:32"/>and his Geſture, in particular Ordinations: or by conſidering of the nature and end of Ordination in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and alſo by deductions from other known Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of your Church grounded on Revelation. You deny not but it is knowable both of theſe ways, but you ſeem to fix your confidence eſpecially on the latter: and ſo between hope and fear, apply your diſtinction to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of my Propoſitions. <hi>Suppoſing, not granting,</hi> ſay you, it cannot be known <hi>that</hi> way, yet it may <hi>this</hi> way, and ſo if the firſt way fail, our Church is not yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain of her Prieſthood. Then you tell more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly what you mean by Nature and End of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 1. As to the Nature of the Thing, that it's Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally impoſſible all the Prieſts of your Church ſhould <hi>maliciouſly</hi> conſpire to omit in Ordination any thing which they believe to be eſſential to it, and which the Church requires as ſuch; and thereby endeavour to damn the whole Church. 2. That this is a Principle with you, That the <hi>Roman</hi> Church <hi>(I mean it in your latitude of ſenſe)</hi> is the Univerſal Church, which Chriſt hath promiſed to maintain and propagate to the worlds end. 3. That your Prieſthood is a neceſſary mean to this end, and therefore God's power will make good his promiſe, by the continuation of your Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. Laſtly, you pretend to retort the like Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I have urged againſt you, and that <hi>it</hi> failing, mine muſt do ſo. <hi>To this purpoſe you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. In the way to the work I chiefly intend, I ſhall acquaint you with a few of the incongruities of your Anſwer, reſerving the farther ſifting of it to its proper place.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. 1. When you have diſtinguiſht of <hi>Knowing a Condition to Ordination</hi> to be gained either by obſerving the Ordaining Prelates exterior Action, Words and Geſtures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or by conſidering the Nature and End of Ordination, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> You ſay, if I underſtand by <hi>knowing,</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:50192:33"/>knowing in the former way only, <hi>which</hi> you ſay, <hi>I ſeem to you to do,</hi> then the firſt Propoſition of my firſt Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſm is falſe.</p>
               <p>Now that the Reader may ſee whether you dream not both of my ſenſe of the word <hi>knowing,</hi> and alſo of the falſeneſs of the Propoſition, I will ſet it down before his eyes. It is thus,</p>
               <q>
                  <p>All Churches that make Prieſtly Ordination depend upon a Condition which no man living knows whether it be fulfill'd, muſt be uncertain whether they have any true Prieſthood.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Let it be noted that theſe are the very firſt words put by way of Argument upon the Queſtion, and then let any man tell me what he ſees in them that hath any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance ſo groſly to ſhackle and confine my ſenſe of the word <hi>knows.</hi> Nay, I muſt firſt be ſuppoſed to act the mad man before I could ſeem ſo to mean: for to what purpoſe do I charge another with the ignorance of a thing, and hope to annoy him with conſequences drawn from that ignorance, if all this while I ſuppoſe that though he cannot know it <hi>one way,</hi> yet he may know it well <hi>another,</hi> and ſo is not at all ignorant as I pronounce him to be. Sure it muſt be thought I meant it could no way be known, ſpeaking relatively to the charge I give, which appears in the ſtate of my Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
               <p>Now, Sir, I leave it to judgment what a ſorry ſhift you have made to get a colour to accuſe a Propoſition of Falſehood. I alſo leave it to judgment, whether it is not moſt probable that the Un-Scholar like courſe you took of deferring to call for the State of the Queſtion, till your Anſwer was given, was not choſen on purpoſe, that when your Matters failed, you might have this to ſay, <hi>for ought I knew he might have underſtood the terms otherwiſe.</hi> But it will not ſerve you for a Blind, even to the meaneſt capacity that reads what I have ſaid of this, <hi>Part I. Sect. II.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:50192:33"/>
               <p>It remains then that your Suppoſition is falſe, and my Propoſition true, for any thing you have ſaid, as yet.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. 2. I note, If your making and applying the ſaid diſtinction to the former Syllogiſm be either a neceſſary or proper work, then you were wanting to your cauſe at <hi>Preſcot,</hi> where you barely denied the <hi>Minor</hi> without any hint of diſtinction or limitation offered; or ſaying one word to the <hi>Major.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. 3. You put me in mind, that I am to prove you Uncertain <hi>according to your own principles.</hi> Which is a needleſs office, ſince you find me doing it already, if you own (as you muſt) theſe two Articles to be your Principles, <hi>viz. That the Intention is neceſſary to the Sacraments,</hi> and <hi>That Ordination is truly and properly a Sacrament.</hi> But then for you to take a poor colour from <hi>thoſe words</hi> to mention your other (fanciful) prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, particularly your believing your ſelves to be the Catholick Church, and to aim at obliging me by vertue of <hi>thoſe words of mine,</hi> to ſubmit to your deductions from them, is an apparent deſign to eſcape from me, and ſuch as betrays your apprehenſion of the neceſſity you are under to quit the field. I have accounted for the ſenſe of <hi>thoſe words</hi> before, and will keep you within juſt Boundaries.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. 4. I ſhall ſhew from the manifeſt drift of your Anſwer, that it is not a <hi>full</hi> Anſwer as you pretend, and your undiſcerning Friends proclaim it to be. This will appear as follows.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. I purpoſed at firſt, as I have told you, only to prove you Uncertain of having any true Prieſts <hi>in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,</hi> becauſe the Prelat's Intention is not diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in your particular Ordinations (an Opponent, let me ſay, <hi>by the way,</hi> may be allowed to give the Senſe of his own words, provided the Senſe he gives make againſt his Adverſary, and ſo contain him within the compaſs of an oppoſition to him.)</p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:50192:34"/>
               <p n="8">§. 8. I add, it appears you apprehended That to be, at leaſt, part of my meaning: for when you had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd of Knowing the Prelate's Intention either by obſerving his Actions Words and Geſture in particular Ordinations, or by conſidering the Nature, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you ſay thus, <hi>If you under ſtand by Knowing here, Knowing in the former way only, which you ſeem to me to do, &amp;c.</hi> I meant, Sir, at that time what in part I ſeemed to you to mean, <hi>viz.</hi> to confound the certainty of your Ordinations <hi>in particular.</hi> And it was ſufficient to argue from your Not knowing by any ſort of means the Ordainers, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in particular Ordinations to your Not knowing the Ordained, in particular, to be true Prieſts; there being <hi>with you</hi> and eſſential dependance between the one and the other. The reſt your words fix upon me you ſhall hear of afterwards, as you have done in part al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
               <p n="9">§. 9. You knew I meant this, as appears; and now I refer it to all diſcerning Readers whether you have hinted one ſingle ground in your Anſwer in Bar of ſuch my attempt againſt you; or ſo much as pretend you have. For ought you have ſaid, I may go on with my deſign againſt you without ſtop or <hi>remora.</hi> I perceive you thought, I might alſo by defeating your Certainty of having any Prieſthood, in particular, go on to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude by way of Induction your Uncertainty of it, in general; and therefore you have caſt up ſome ſort of Mud-walls (whoſe ſtrength I ſhall try anon) to ſecure your ſelf on that ſide: but you have left your ſelf na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and open, where you were ſenſible I muſt firſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault you. Which hapned not, I think, for want of regard to your cauſe, but becauſe you had no general ſtory to tell, which would ſeem to ſecure you, as to this.</p>
               <p n="10">§. 10. 5. I apprehend not your Anſwer to be either ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary or artificial. When you hold the Intention knowable in both the ways you mention, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50192:34"/>that my Propoſitions you apply your diſtinctions to, are altogether or abſolutely falſe, what need you as Reſpondent, do more than Simply deny them? In a courſe of Argumentation, a full ſtop is that way put to Falſhood; and ſo there needed not very many Words to have effected this. It is the Truth of Propoſitions in one Senſe, and not in another, that makes diſtinctions requiſite; and therefore yours cannot be requiſite while you deny Mine to be true in any Senſe. The manner of applying Diſtinctions by Learned men evinces all I ſay, which uſually runs thus, If <hi>the Word,</hi> or, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be taken in <hi>this</hi> Senſe, your Propoſition is falſe for <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but if in <hi>that</hi> Senſe, I may grant the Thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diſadvantage to my ſelf.</p>
               <p>But if a Man pleaſes to make an unneceſſary diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſaying, Such a Propoſition may admit theſe two Senſes, but it is falſe in both of them; and if he proceed to aſſign Reaſons why it is not true in one of thoſe Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, me-thinks Order requires he ſhould likewiſe do it in the other, there being the ſame Reaſon he ſhould omit or perform it in both.</p>
               <p n="11">§. 11. This, Sir, is your Caſe; your Anſwer is made up partly of a diſtinction, which is unneceſſary upon your Suppoſition of the abſolute falſity of my Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and partly of (ſeeming) Reaſons given why they are falſe in one of the two Senſes, mentioned; but there is no Cauſe alledged why they are not true in the other: Wherefore I conclude your Anſwer is neither neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nor Artificial.</p>
               <p>I heartily beg the Readers pardon for having ſpent too much time in the more general conſideration of your Anſwer, which yet I have done to undeceive the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauders of it. I ſhall now bend my ſelf to my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken Province, <hi>viz.</hi> to prove the Major of my ſecond Syllogiſm, to which your diſtinction may (in ſome ſort) be applied, though it could not congruouſly to any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in the firſt.</p>

               <p>SIR, the Propoſition which you deny, and I am now to prove, is this, <hi>The Intention of the Biſhop is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition which no Man living knows, whether it be fulfill'd or no in Ordination.</hi> To be ſhort and clear, I put it thus, <hi>No Man knows whether or no the Biſhop's Intention be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in Ordination.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. It cannot be known by Reaſon, as I prove thus,</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <q>
                     <hi>§. 2.</hi> No man knows whether or no the Biſhop's Intention be preſent in Ordination, either by the Evidence they have of it <hi>in its ſelf,</hi> or <hi>in any Effects of it:</hi> Or <hi>(which comes all to one)</hi> no man knows it either by Intuition or Diſcourſe, <hi>Ergo,</hi> No man knows by Reaſon whether or no it be preſent in Ordination.</q>
               </p>
               <p>All the ways that can be ſuppoſed to know the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Reaſon, are reckoned up in the Antecedent; and therefore if That be made good, the Conſequent ſtands firm, by reaſon of its juſt dependance on it.</p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:50192:35"/>
               <p>I ſhall evince that it can be known neither of theſe ways; and ſhall uſe more and freer words to do it, than a rigorous frame of Argumentation would admit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Men not bred to the ſtrict formality of diſcourſe may that way judge more naturally of what is offered; and might otherwiſe be at ſome loſs.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. I ſhall, in paſſing, deſcribe <hi>Seeing of a thing in it ſelf,</hi> or intuitive Knowledge to be That which is formed by the proper <hi>Idea,</hi> or Similitude of the Thing known, and when the Underſtanding is carried immediately to the Object, without the help of Diſcourſe. It may be illuſtrated by our Experience of Senſitive intuition, <hi>ex. gr.</hi> We immediately know thoſe proper Objects of Sight that are ſet before our eyes; and not by any run of our thoughts from one thing to another, in order to get the Knowledge of them. By this we may meaſure the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of intuitive Intellection. Now to the Point.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. 1. The Intention of one Man cannot be known to another, <hi>in it ſelf,</hi> or by intuitive Intellection. For though God hath given us Faculties to aſſure us imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately of the proper Objects of our Senſes, and of thoſe Verities uſually called Firſt Principles, or Common No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by which we meaſure the knowledge of other things; yet he hath not thought fit to give us <hi>any,</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to inſpect the ſecrets of another's heart. Now the Intention of the Biſhop, whereof we treat, is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly one of thoſe Secrets.</p>
               <p>Liberty and Freedom is Eſſential to the Will, (which is the onely power capable of exerting that Act:) and therefore, though it be furniſhed with all prae-requiſites to its Acting, yet it may <hi>intend,</hi> or it may not; and how can any man pretend to know whether it do, or not? Humane Underſtanding cannot penetrate the receſſes of that free immaterial power, nor break open that beſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured of all created Cloſets.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. So far are the particular mere Acts of the Will
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50192:36"/>from being pervious to the eye of man, that according to the moſt and greateſt Authors, the Angels themſelves cannot (at leaſt, this way) know them. <hi>Aquinas, Cajetan, Suarez, Valentia, Vaſquez, Hurtad,</hi> and many more, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the Thing, as I have ſaid: And indeed the caſe is ſo clear, that I need but touch upon the words of one or two of them.</p>
               <p>The Queſtion in <hi>Aquinas,</hi> is<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trum Angeli cognoſcunt cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tationes cordium.</note>, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Angels know the thoughts of the heart?</hi> And he reſolves it in the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, upon this ground<note n="|" place="margin">Ex ſola voluntate dependet quòd aliquis actu aliqua conſideret. Pars <hi>1.</hi> Quaeſt. <hi>57.</hi> Art. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note>, <hi>It wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the Will that any one actually conſiders any thing.</hi> Becauſe the Will is the only power in Man, that is formally free, and this power ſets the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding on work, he concludes that the particular acts of the underſtanding cannot immediately be known by the Angels themſelves. If then theſe cannot be known for the Reaſon alledged, much leſs can the mere Acts of the Will, which is intrinſecally and formally free.</p>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>Cajetan</hi> words it thus<note n="*" place="margin">Dicimus quod Cogitatio, co quod volita ſeu libera, eſt naturaliter oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culta. <hi>in locum.</hi>
                  </note>, <hi>We ſay that the Thought, becauſe it is volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary or free, is therefore naturally ſecret, or hidden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Suitably to theſe two Authors doth <hi>Hurtad</hi> offer the ſame Doctrine by way of remark<note n="|" place="margin">Adverte ſecretum cordis eſſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los actus voluntatis. Metaph. Diſp. <hi>12.</hi> Sect. <hi>4. §. 30.</hi>
                  </note>. <hi>Mark,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that only the Acts of the Will are the Secrets of the Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if the Will be ſealed up from the view of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, much more is it from that of Men. Were it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s Queſtion would put this Point out of doubt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. <hi>What Man knoweth the things of a Man, ſave the Spirit of Man which is in him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. It will farther appear, that theſe Secrets fall not within the immediate cognizance of Man, if I ſhew in a few words, that they are onely open to the eye of God,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50192:36"/>Who at once knows all things, paſt, preſent, and to come, by a pure and immutable Act; that is, by his very Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. The Authors newly named, having denied that view to Created Beings, go on to appropriate it to God. I will only mention <hi>Aquinas</hi>'s Words, which are ſhort and plain<note n="*" place="margin">Ea quae ex voluntate ſola depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, vel quae in voluntate ſola ſunt, ſoli Deo ſunt nota.

               <q>
                  <p>Thoſe things which depend on the Will onely, or which are in the Will onely, are known to God alone.</p>
               </q>
               <p>But a far greater Authority, <hi>viz.</hi> the Scripture, leaves no doubt for this, aſſerting in many places, that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the Knowledge of thoſe Secrets to himſelf, as an incommunicable Prerogative. I need refer but to a few. <hi>Jer.</hi> 179, 10.— <hi>I the Lord ſearch the Heart, I try the Reins.</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.17. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.9. <hi>Acts</hi> 1.24, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Sum of what hath appeared here, is, That the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Ordaining Biſhop is not Knowable <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately or in it ſelf,</hi> by any created intellect: Nor can it be ſeen in its Cauſe, by reaſon of that Dominion a Free Agent hath over its own Acts; which it may, or may not, exert, when it pleaſes.</p>
               <p>If it be askt me, Why God hath given any Faculty to any of his Creatures, which as to its particular tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, is impenetrable to the ſharpeſt eye of Man or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel; I might take up with reſolving it ſolely into the Divine pleaſure. However, it ſeems congruous to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it ſhould be ſo: Which thing I ſhall ſet forth in the Words of <hi>Balthazar Tellez</hi>

               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:50192:37"/>
               <p n="2">2. As I have ſhewn that the Biſhop's Intention can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be known <hi>in it ſelf</hi> by any beſides himſelf; ſo, Sir, I now come to ſhew that it cannot be known by any effects.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. The Reaſon is, It is ſo merely and intirely an Act of the Will, that it is the Act of no other power; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently doth not of it ſelf produce any Term or Effect without the Will; for which reaſon ſuch Acts are called <hi>immanent</hi> both by Philoſophers and School Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines. But it would be needleſs here to cite them. The Term or Effect then being ſhut up in the Will, it is no more diſcoverable than the Act it ſelf, which you, without ground, ſuppoſe to be manifeſted by it; and ſo you have nothing to argue from in that caſe, as from a thing more known, to a thing leſs known, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt remain uncertified of the Being of the Act, unleſs you can invent ſome other mean of diſcovery. The Will hath no ſuch dependance upon, nor connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with any natural cauſe in its acting, as that it muſt impreſs upon the Body any ſenſible marks of its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in which we may ſurely read when and what it acts; as alteration of Voice, change of Countenance, or any the like thing from which you pretend to make a judgment of it. <hi>Aquinas</hi> will tell you this, with the reaſon of it.<note n="*" place="margin">In actu appetitus intellectivi non requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritur aliqua tranſmutatio corporalis, quia bujuſmodi appetitus non eſt virtus alicujus Organi, <hi>prim. ſecund. q 22. Ar. 3.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>No change in the Body neceſſarily attends an Act of the Will, becauſe ſuch an appetite is not the virtue of any [bodily] <hi>Organ.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>I add, if any motion ſhould <hi>by accident</hi> reſult in the Body from the actual Will, as ſigns of joy, or ſorrow, or ſhame, <hi>&amp;c..</hi> yet this can lead only to the diſcerning ſome affections of the Will, in general; but not any particular Act of it.</p>
               <p>Hence I conclude, you can never ſecure your notion of knowing the Biſhop's Intention by obſerving his
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50192:37"/>Action, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> till you make the Will to be a material power, and <hi>immanent</hi> Actions to be <hi>tranſient;</hi> which yet is impoſſible to be done.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe you aſſign no other way of knowing the Intention in particular, than making the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned obſervations, I will take the freedom to deal a little more ſamiliarly with you about it.</p>
               <p>I will ſuppoſe here, that a Biſhop doth with a laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſhew of Gravity pronounce the Words, and do the exterior Action your Church requires to Ordination, and that hardly any Biſhop comes ſhort of that, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to confer holy Orders; but when I have done, I remain ignorant how I may certainly conclude from ſuch his performance, whether he thereby intend to confer Spiritual power, or to do as the Church doth; and therefore would learn that skill from you. Either inform me that there is an individual connexion between his doing the one, and intending the other, or tell me when, and in what circumſtances, the connexion fails. The exterior Action is too dim, and indeed too uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Glaſs to ſee this in.</p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. May not a man do a thing <hi>materially good,</hi> and directly commanded by God, without intending the End God requires? What think you of ſome mens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the poor, from no higher a Motive than that of vain glory? <hi>Matt.</hi> 6.1. What think you of ſome mens frequent ſaying their prayers for the ſame low end? <hi>v.</hi> 5. Our bleſſed Saviour plainly intimates that others may miſtake the Intention of ſuch, and earneſtly applaud them for righteous perſons; and that God only, <hi>who ſees in ſecret,</hi> can detect their carnal purpoſes and crooked wills. Did not <hi>Judas</hi> declare it his deſire to have the Bag ſaved for the ſake of the poor, when he meant it only for his own advantage? <hi>John</hi> 12.6. He ſpoke good words, and did a ſeemingly-kind action to our Lord, he ſaid, Hail Maſter and kiſſed him, when
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50192:38"/>he intended not to expreſs any true affection but to betray him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.49. I forbear to multiply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this ſort, theſe now given being ſufficient to evince, that there is no neceſſary dependance between the exterior actions of men and their interior Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and conſequently it is no ſure arguing from thoſe to theſe.</p>
               <p n="9">§. 9. For the Ordainer's Geſture, I think you bring it in to no great purpoſe. Do you fancy <hi>Judas</hi> laught in our Saviour's face when he paſſed upon him that trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous Ceremony? Or that the Phariſees flear'd or made Mowes, when they gave their Alms, or ſaid their Prayers, in token of their acting for undue ends? Are there not <hi>Sinons</hi> yet in the world? May not a ſerious face frequently diſguiſe a diſſembling heart? Were the outward appearance always the true Picture of the mind, Hypocriſie would upon the matter, be wholly diveſted of its Eſſence. In an <hi>Irony</hi> there is indeed (as it were) a natural diſcovery of the contrariety of the Mind to the Words ſpoken; but in formal Hypocriſie a ſtudious concealment of the repugnance between the motions of the heart and the outward appearance.</p>
               <p>Were your Biſhops wont in an openly ludicrous or ſportive manner to pronounce the Form and apply the Matter of Ordination, your obſervation of their Geſture might tend to your diſcerning that ſometimes they were not in earneſt, but ſtill we want a mean to know when they intend aright. We have proved a grave out-ſide will not aſſure us of this. But I think no Biſhop in the world will do ſo childiſh an act, or expoſe himſelf to ſcorn or hatred, or danger by an apparent mock-Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and ſo your obſerving of their Geſture will not ſo much as enable you to know when they <hi>intend not.</hi> I will put the Caſe further, may not a Biſhop who actually intends to make a Prieſt, chance to ſmile at ſome odd ſight when he is pronouncing the words—
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50192:38"/>
                  <hi>Accipe poteſtatem,</hi> &amp;c. Or would any man in that caſe pronounce the Ordination a nullity? I think not. Pray tell us then in what manner you are guided to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Ordainer's Intention by your obſervation of his Geſture. I am afraid, when you explain your ſelf we ſhall have a ſad ſtory of it.</p>
               <p>Beſides, there is a manifeſt inſufficiency in your Rule of judgment, which is the Biſhop's words, actions and geſture in Ordination; for after your way, you can only pretend to know whether or no he actually intends in the Adminiſtration of Orders: but ſuppoſing you could find that he doth not <hi>then ſo intend,</hi> your obſervation is worth nothing; For, 1. Your Church requires it not as neceſſary that he ſhould <hi>then actually intend;</hi> if he do it virtually, it will anſwer the End it is required for, as is proved before<note n="*" place="margin">Part I. Sect. VII.</note>. 2. Your obſerving his Action afterwards cannot ſurely lead you to an intrinſecally contingent Act of his Will which paſſed a minute or two before the Action done. He may have intended for ought you know, before, (which is called the virtual Intention in the time of the Action) but whether he did or no, you cannot be certified by the ſubſequent Action, except you have a ſingular gift of diſcerning, not known to the reſt of Mankind.</p>
               <p>If you have ſuch a gift, and can communicate your skill of knowing the ſecrets of man's heart by obſerving his Words, Actions and Geſtures, it may be of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary uſe to the world. Many ſorts of men might avoid great harms otherwiſe incident to them, by virtue of your inſtructions. Princes would be ſecured from employing ſervants that meant not Faith and Secrecy when they promiſe them. Maſters and Parents would at a notable rate inſpect the minds of ſervants and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And Mental Reſervations would hereby become unprofitable, which would be a great loſs ſomewhere. If you can in the manner aforeſaid, judge of ſuch a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50192:39"/>Act of the Will, you are ſufficiently enabled to make all theſe and many more ſuch diſcoveries.</p>
               <p>But alas! Your Notion is a mere dream, as I have ſhewed by barely declaring, That the meer interior, elicit Acts of the Will (and <hi>our</hi> Intention is one of them) make not <hi>of themſelves</hi> any ſuch ſenſible im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions upon the Body, as that another can make there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by any ſure judgment of them: and that they make no ſuch impreſſions <hi>by accident</hi> as will reach that end.</p>
               <p>I have therefore forborn to confirm what I have ſaid of the Nature of the Will and her Acts, by nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Teſtimony, becauſe I expect no Adverſary here. However I will add a few words more to confront your method of Trial.</p>
               <p n="10">§. 10. Your greateſt Authors deſcribe the Intention I ſpeak of, by ſuch Epithets as ſhew they held it not to be knowable by your way. They call it <hi>mental</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Now they would not have ſpoken thus, merely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Intention is not knowable <hi>immediately,</hi> or <hi>in it ſelf,</hi> if yet it had been knowable by any neceſſary connexion with ſome other thing we know by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of Senſe or Experience; for they call That evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent knowledge which is ſo collected. But they call <hi>it</hi> properly Mental, Occult, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe it is not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with any other thing which may ſurely lead us to it. I ſhall illuſtrate this by an inſtance, when out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Actions are done immediately or proximately by the lower executive powers, upon the command (as I may ſay) and motion of the Will, (which are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called <hi>imperate</hi>) ſuch Actions are called the actions <hi>of the Will,</hi> or voluntary actions: and yet no wiſe man will call theſe <hi>Occult</hi> or <hi>properly Mental.</hi> For though the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50192:39"/>motion of the Will be <hi>ſecret</hi> in it ſelf, yet we have now ſome ſenſible effect ſo dependent upon and connexed with it, that all that are not ſtrangers to the Ordinary courſe of Nature, may be aſſured of the preſence of the Will in ſuch Actions. I muſt grant, Sir, your writing an Anſwer to my Argument to be a voluntary action, and that your purpoſe to write it was not viſible in it ſelf; yet it is ſufficiently made ſo by your doing it. And on this ſcore your <hi>Will</hi> or purpoſe to write it ought to be called an <hi>open</hi> or <hi>exterior,</hi> not an <hi>interior</hi> or <hi>hidden</hi> purpoſe. But then if we ſeek after the particular End you <hi>intended</hi> in writing it, we ſhall not be able to find the ſecret. Whether you thereby intended to honour God by vindicating a <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> Truth of his, which I had aſſaulted; or to pleaſe your ſelf by baffling your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure neighbour, or to gain ſome reputation (or other advantage) with your party by a dextrous defence of your Cauſe, is, and muſt be, a ſecret to all beſides your ſelf; nor would the beſt obſervation made of your Action and Geſtures, while you was at work, have aſcertained the Spectators of your Intention.</p>
               <p>So then your purpoſe to anſwer me is manifeſt by what I ſee; but your <hi>intent</hi> in doing it I muſt remain uncertain of, for want of a ſure ground to argue from, to the knowledge of it.</p>
               <p>Well. That concerned in our Queſtion is the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the End, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which effects nothing without the Will, from whence we may derive any certainty of it, and therefore it is truly called <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>hidden,</hi> and <hi>mental</hi> by your Authors laſt cited; and conſequently the Ordainer's Intention is ſuppoſed by them (and many others that ſpeak the ſame language) not to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable by <hi>your</hi> external obſervation.</p>
               <p n="11">§. 11. I add, If it be God's prerogative to ſearch the Heart, your Notion of diſcerning the Intention wants foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in as much as That doth not only exclude Man from
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50192:40"/>the <hi>intuitive,</hi> but alſo from the <hi>diſcurſive</hi> Knowledge of it. For if it might ſurely be known this way, then Men were alſo Searchers of the Heart. On that ſuppoſition, the Thing is not denied to Men, but onely the Mode of it. But if the Manner of Knowing made all the difference here, Why ſhould the Knowledge of the Heart be more eminently aſcribed to God, than the Knowledge of any thing elſe, ſince he knows all things alike, and the ſame way, <hi>viz.</hi> by his own Eſſence? I conclude then the meaning of the Attribution to be this, That God hath reſerved the inſpection of the Heart to his own eye, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by the Spirituality of its Nature, ſo ſhut it up from others, that the Agent himſelf cannot in ſome caſes aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure another of the Being of its particular Acts. And the Prelate's Intention (as hath been often ſaid) is one of theſe. Hence your ableſt Writers ſpeaking of this Act, do not onely ſay, it may be hid, but that it is always ſo.

               </p>
               <p>I mention not Good Angels here, becauſe, 1. The Secrets of man's Heart, as appeared before, is lockt up from them. 2. Were they privy to them, yet we have no Ordinary <hi>Obſervable</hi> Commerce with them. 3. Nor have Rules to diſcern their true Declarations of Fact from Satanical Deluſions.</p>
               <p>I therefore made the Teſtimony of God and Men to be a ſufficient Partition of Authority in the preſent caſe.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now make good both Parts of the Antecedent, and then the Conſequent will ſtand firm.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. 1. It is not knowable by any Revelation of God. For if we read Scripture from beginning to end, we ſhall find neither Prophecy to foretel, nor Promiſe to aſſure, That all the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops in general, nor <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> in particular, throughout the ſeveral Centuries from the Apoſtles days, nor in any one of them, ſhall in their

               <p>Tradition is alſo ſilent here; nor is it, whatever other uſes it may ſerve to, pretended to prefent us with ſuch Notices. Wherefore I conclude, We cannot attain the Knowledge of the Biſhop's Intention by Revelation.</p>

               <p>To make this good to full ſatisfaction, 1.

               <q>
                  <p>I note it here as a Thing ordained by the Divine Wiſdom, to preſerve us from Impoſtures, that Men are (as it were) naturally bent to detect the Errors of others, and to expoſe ſuch as they obſerve to advance a Fiction for true Fact. A ſecret pleaſure attends this work, and a Reputation follows it; and ſometimes an uncharitable Temper promotes it. And conſequently inſenſible notable Objects, the miſreports of ſome will be blaſted, by the contrary affirmation of others, at leaſt ſo far, that they ſhall not gain the Authority of an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, uncontrouled Teſtimony.</p>

               <p n="9">§. 9. (1.) It is not a Senſible Object, but a Spiritual or immaterial Act, ſhut up in a Faculty, which (as we have ſeen already<note n="*" place="margin">Part 11. Sect. <hi>4.</hi>

               <p n="10">§. 10. (2.) And conſequently, as no creature can ſee it but the ſingle Agent himſelf, ſo none is capable of contradicting his Relation of it, if it ſhould be (as it may be) in it ſelf falſe. So then a grand Rule of Trial moſt conducible to Moral aſſurance, is wanting on this ſcore, and then what a rational ſtreſs can be laid on ſuch Teſtimony?</p>
               <p n="11">§. 11. (3.) Were the Object <hi>of it ſelf</hi> liable to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon obſervation, yet one witneſs is not ſufficient to challenge our Credence.</p>
               <p>God himſelf was pleaſed in the Old Teſtament<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut</hi> 19.5.</note> to intimate, that a ſingle witneſs was leſs credible than many, and not to be truſted in matters of moment; and our Bleſſed Saviour hath repeated it in the New<note n="‖" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p n="12">§. 12. (4.) As there can be no more but a ſingle wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Caſe, ſo he may reaſonably be ſuſpected to affirm on his own behalf, or for his own Intereſts: and if ſo (which will appear ſhortly) it will much leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the value of his Teſtimony.

               <p n="13">§. 13. Now that any Biſhop in the world may be a party concerned (and therefore an incompetent wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) in affirming he intended as the Church requires, will be eaſily made appear. If he be declared Anathema (as he is by the <hi>Trent</hi> Council) who denies the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50192:43"/>of the Intention to the Sacraments, ſure no light puniſhment would be allotted to that Biſhop who ſhould diſcover that he defeated his Ordinations of their Efficacy by omitting to intend as the Church requires. This crime is called Sacriledge by your Authors; and it muſt be ſuch in a high degree according to your Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis, it being beyond compariſon, more hainous to rob mens ſouls of Sacramental Grace, than Churches of conſecrated Cups or Patens. Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication may be well ſuppoſed to be inflicted upon the Criminal Biſhop, which Cenſure is followed with ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſion from Office and Benefit, and with the loſs of the priviledges of the Laws, as your Authors teach<note n="‖" place="margin">See for this Card. <hi>Caje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>'s Summuls. verb.

               <p>At beſt ſhame and reproach will attend ſuch a diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very: on which account I find ſome of your Caſuiſts ſhie of adviſing the Miniſters of the Sacraments to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal the matter, when they have rendred them ineſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual through their <hi>Not-intending</hi> or otherwiſe. For example, when a Prieſt hath given an <hi>invalid</hi> Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he muſt be cautious of making it known<note n="*" place="margin">Nè ſi poenitens admoneatur, ſequetur ſcandalum vel infamia. <hi>Suarez. tom. 4. par. 2. diſp. 32.

               <p>But guilt is jealous of the harms ſometimes ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to ſuch diſcoveries; and ſince the offender will be judge, he will hardly think himſelf ſafe, ſave in a deep concealment of ſuch his faults; and therefore will like thoſe Authors beſt that furniſh him with the beſt Evaſions.</p>
               <p n="14">§. 14. Thus have we found that the Biſhop's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their Not-intending aright, may expoſe them to loſs, or ſhame, or both; and ſad experience tells us that many are more tender of their Riches and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50192:43"/>than of their Conſcience; and apt to ſackiſice Truth to their worldly welfare. And therefore when a Biſhop is askt, <hi>how he intended in ſuch an Ordination,</hi> none knows but ſuch reſpects may prevail with him to make an untrue Anſwer. If he have wilfully offended in that point, we may expect he will cloak his malice with a Lye; if through groſs careleſneſs, he may ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly conceal it: But ſuppoſe he hath done his duty, his telling us ſo cannot prove it, becauſe it is but every way the ſame Anſwer they give, who have tranſgreſs'd it.</p>
               <p n="15">§. 15. The ſumm hereof is this, There is hardly any thing alike between the two Things I have now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared. <hi>There</hi> an object liable to the obſervation of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; not ſo <hi>here.

There</hi> no perſonal intereſt makes the Teſtimony ſuſpicious, <hi>here</hi> the ſingle witneſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth for himſelf.</p>
               <p>The Inference from hence is this, <hi>There</hi> a ſtrong Aſſent is founded, <hi>here</hi> a weak one. <hi>There</hi> is certainty, <hi>here</hi> is none.</p>
               <p n="16">§. 16. I add, I am perſwaded that <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks ſeldom (if ever) actually have the ſlender ſecurity of the ſaid ſingle Teſtimony. For I never heard in my Converſe with them, nor read in any of their Books, that they uſe to ask their Miniſters, whether they In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend aright or no.

               <p>Among the vaſt Numbers of your Clergy, (as it alſo happens to thoſe of other Churches) there muſt be many irreligious and immoral men, not ſo Chriſtianly qualified, as You and I could wiſh: And then according to the Rule laid down, How many Hoſts conſecrated by ſuch, may be adored with doubting Minds; How many Abſolutions given, whoſe Virtue may be rationally que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned, <hi>&amp;c?</hi>

               <p>I confeſs, a good Conſcience, or a Principle of Grace, is a very Operative thing, and excites to watchful dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in duty, where it really is: But it is fit we ſhould know, 1.

               <p n="12">§. 12. Suppoſing your Miniſters had undeniably a certainty of their Grace, equal to a Moral Certainty, which admits no fear of the contrary; yet all beſides themſelves, for the Reaſon given, muſt fall ſhort of that Aſſurance, and ſo take up with <hi>

               <p>From what hath been thus ſet forth, I ſhall now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Argument offered by the cited Author, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of your being ſatisfied, that your Miniſters of the Sacraments <hi>duly intend</hi> in the Adminiſtration of them.</p>

The building can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſtronger than the foundation; nor the concluſion more evident than the premiſſes.</p>
               </q>
               <p n="15">§. 15. Moreover: Your caſe is yet worſe than this; For you are greater Strangers to the particular Mental
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:50192:46"/>Acts of your Miniſters, than you are to the Frame and Habit of their Minds. For you may fairly gueſs at This, by obſerving a full courſe of their Outward Actions, but not near ſo well at theſe Acts. The Reaſon is, a good Man may omit a good act, or do an ill one, without the deſtruction of his good habit, which denominates him ſuch. To accommodate this to our caſe, it is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, That the Miniſter's Intention may be obſtructed, not onely by malice or contempt of Religion, or groſs Negligence; but alſo by Natural inadvertence, or ſuch accidental prevalent cares, or fears, or deep concerning Studies, as in groſs, and (as I may ſay) ſwallow up the mind, or hale it from a duty in hand, elſewhither. In theſe latter Inſtances, there may chance to be a defect of the Intention, without a wicked Habit in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter: So then the Connexion between good Habits and ſuch particular Acts is not certain, and therefore not to be depended on.</p>
               <p n="16">§. 16. The reſult, as to our preſent concern, is this, 1. As it is but probable (as <hi>probable</hi> is oppoſed to <hi>moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly certain</hi>) your Biſhops have Chriſtian minds, (remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I ſpeak of them <hi>in particular</hi>) So is it but probable that in their Ordinations they intend as your Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, the Evidence of the latter depending on that of the former, according to the Argument I deal with. 2. It is not ſo probable that they ſo intend, as it is that they are Chriſtianly affected, a good man being liable to omit a good Act he ought to perform, and this not deſtructive of his gracious Habit. Nothing is left for you, but looſe Sand, inſtead of a pretended Rock, to build your certainty upon.</p>
               <p>Having largely examined the moſt plauſible Plea, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Catholicks have for their Security, that their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters intend as they ought, and diſarmed it of its ſtrength; I ſhall now, in way of ſurpluſage, ſhew how hopeleſs it is, for the end it was brought for, from the Context of the cited place.</p>

               <p>The Author had declared, that though the interior Intention be required to the Sacraments, yet when men ſee the exterior Actions done, they may quiet their minds with a perſwaſion, that the Miniſters intend as the Church requires them: And ſeeing an Objection ſtare him in the Face, He ſets himſelf to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it.

               <p>The Author then having granted that there is no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident Certainty of the Intention, doth in effect grant, that the Underſtanding cannot view it for want of light, nor imbrace it as a Thing in Being.

As I can no longer que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion the Being of what I ſee plainly with my bodily eyes, ſo neither can I, what I ſee with thoſe of my mind. But no Natural Beams lighten this Object; it is confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to lie in darkneſs.</p>
               <p n="20">§. 20. (2.) He ſaith, ſuch certainty is not neceſſary, in order to the Quiet of the Conſcience. But, I ſay, ſomething is neceſſary to that End, becauſe Anxiety would oppreſs the Soul, were it left to fluctuate about the weighty matters of Religion, ſuch as the Truth of our Sacraments are acknowledged to be. And it hath been ſhewn that the Truth of theſe cannot be known, unleſs the Miniſter's Intention be ſo too. Well: Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent certainty is given away; but what brings the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to ſupply it? Why, he lays no claim to that obſoure Certainty that is founded on Authority. He neither ſaith, There is the infallible Teſtimony of God for the Thing, nor yet the credible Teſtimony of men: Which ſilence is a tacit confeſſion, he had no ſuch thing to plead, it being then his Province to ſay all he could to ſecure the Soul in that Point.</p>
               <p n="21">§. 21. (3.) He gives this moſt ſorry Reaſon, why it was not neceſſary <hi>ſo</hi> to know the Intention in Baptiſm, (of which he was ſpeaking) <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> we are not always certain that our Miniſters are true Prieſts.</p>
               <p>The relation of theſe Words to the former, ſeems to make the whole ſound but <hi>this,</hi> viz. Baptiſm fares no worſe than Ordination; let us hope well of both, but we
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50192:47"/>are certain of neither. When he cannot cure the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady, he gives them Narcoticks to ſtill and ſtun the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that they may be leſs ſenſible of their pain. Let us not torment our ſelves but believe the beſt, is the effect of his words, to my underſtanding.</p>
               <p n="22">§. 22. Yet he minces the matter. We are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways certain, <hi>&amp;c. ſaith he.</hi> Then never certain, <hi>ſay I,</hi> upon the account of the Intention: (which he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely treats of in that Article.) But are there not greater hopes when moral men Adminiſter? Yes. But I have proved there is no certainty.</p>
               <p n="23">§. 23. But becauſe of ſome inconveniences which that diſtinction of good and bad Miniſters, as applied before, may chance to breed among <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, I will now ſuppoſe that by the words, <hi>Good Men</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Homines probos.</note>, the Author meant to deſcribe all their Miniſters promiſcuouſly How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever not daring to truſt this Notion; I have conſidered them as implying the fore-named diſtinction. I would not impoſe a meaning upon any man's words, but take his own, if I knew it. In this method I cannot miſs his Senſe: it muſt be <hi>here</hi> or <hi>there.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="24">§. 24. Well, I conſtrue the words <hi>thus,</hi> when we ſee any Miniſter do the Sacramental Actions, we believe he hath a Chriſtian mind and duely Intends. Now I proceed to ſay, it hath already appeared that there is neither Evidence nor Authority claimed by the Author to ſecure the Conſcience in this matter: And therefore I conclude his <hi>Credimus</hi> [We believe] only denotes the judgment of Charity, which he conceives ſufficient to ſtay and ſettle the mind.</p>
               <p n="25">§. 25. Sir, I will freely grant you this judgment of Charity for your Miniſters, and conſequently for their intending aright. For where there are not manifeſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of Vice, we are to account every man Virtuous; and for things that look doubtful, we are rather to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret them in the more favourable ſenſe, when there
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50192:48"/>is an Obligation upon us to paſs our judgment. But this tye of making a charitable judgment is too weak a ſtay for Conſcience in the great concerns of Religion, ſuch as the Miniſter's Intention, on which you make your Baptiſm, the Conſecration of the Euchariſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> depend. This will appear by conſidering theſe two things,</p>
               <p n="26">§. 26. (1.) The judgment of Charity alwaies ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the Object Uncertain; or to ſpeak more properly, the Underſtanding Uncertain. For what needs Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity come into the Scale, if Evidence hath weighed it down beforehand? What needs the Will come into the work, but that the Underſtanding is at a loſs?</p>
               <p n="27">§. 27. (2.) The Soul is not a jot nearer Truth by this judgment of Charity. The pious affection of the Will is indeed exerciſed, but it makes not the Act of the Underſtanding more certain. Truth is the Object of the Intellect alone, and therefore certainty is not at all taken from the Will, but from the Evidence of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, or from the motive to Faith.</p>
               <p n="28">§. 28. I forbear to add, That the Underſtanding may be eaſily, and is often expoſed to the danger of falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood by the charitable inclination of the Will; and that ignorance may contribute much to the falſe quiet of the mind. The will hath nothing to do with the Underſtanding (that I know of) in order to Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but barely to ſtir it up to act. When that is done, it muſt judge for it ſelf, and hath Rules of its own to examine things by; but the bent or biaſs of the Will is none of them. And he that makes himſelf (as I may ſo ſay) certain without or beyond Rational Motives, is but blindly perſwaded or pertinacious.</p>
               <p>I have ſaid enough, if not too much, to convince That the judgment of Charity concerning the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, amounts not to an <hi>intellectual</hi> certainty of it. Which is the only thing I was concerned to make out, in this place.</p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:50192:48"/>
               <p n="29">§. 29. Now ſince neither Reaſon nor Authority will aſcertain the Intention, and ſince the Judgment of Charity falls ſhort of the mark, I may, I hope, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preſumption conclude that my Propoſition is veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Intention of the [Ordaining] Biſhop is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition which no man living knows whether it be fulfill'd or no in Ordination.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then the premiſes being true, the concluſion is ſo too, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Church of</hi> Rome <hi>requires a condition to Ordination which no man living knows whether it be fulfill'd or no.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I confeſs I have extended my proof to a far greater Latitude (as I have done ſome other things in theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers) than any thing you have offered, exacted from me: but I had rather be accuſed of being over than ſhort. Beſides, I had a mind to prevent the often re-hearing of the Cauſe, to which ſeveral little new Suggeſtions might give occaſion, by a more particular ſifting of it. I had alſo a reſpect to ſome others, who had never ſeen the Subject ſet in a full light. But after all, I am ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible I have done ſomething more than needed.</p>
               <p n="30">§. 30. I have indeed conſidered the Propoſition only under the limitation before expreſs'd, excepting the Ordaining Biſhops out of <hi>no man living</hi> knows. Who may therefore pretend to know their own Intention, and by conſequence that there are true Prieſts among you. But if an Interpretation I gave you of my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition at <hi>Pn.</hi> had not (without Reaſon) been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to you, what I have already done would have left your Biſhops unſecured of your Prieſthood, as well as all the reſt of your Communion.</p>
               <p>However I ſhall with little ado cure that defect by offering the ſame thing in ſuch words, as will not, I think, be evaded.</p>

               <p>In order hereunto I will let my firſt Syllogiſm ſtand as before<note n="*" place="margin">Part I. Sect. l.</note>. The <hi>minor</hi> Propoſition of it, which only could regularly be denied, is this, <hi>The</hi> Roman <hi>Church requires a condition to Ordination which no man living knows whether or no it be fulfill'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To wrap up the Biſhops in the ſame uncertainty with the reſt, I prove it thus,</p>
               <q>
                  <p>The Intention of a perſon who is a true Biſhop is a Condition which no man living knows, the Ordainers themſelves not excepted, whether it be fulfilled in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Roman</hi> Church requires the Intention of a perſon who is a true Biſhop to Ordination. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Church requires a condition to Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which no man living knows, the Ordainers themſelves not excepted, whether it be fulfill'd in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The <hi>minor</hi> is clear, for it is not every man's uſing the Matter and Form of the Church, and intending to do as the Church doth, (although you ſay, This may ſuffice to Baptiſm) that you hold to be ſufficient to ordination. You judge not only Lay-men but ſimple
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50192:49"/>Prieſts uncapable of doing that work, as the Curſe of your <hi>Trent</hi>-Council makes appear<note n="*" place="margin">Si quis dixcrit Epiſcopos non eſſe Presbyteris ſuperiores, vel non babete poteſtatem Confirmandi &amp; Ordinandi, vel cam quam habent illis cum Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris communem eſſe, Auathema ſit. <hi>Seſſ. 23.

               <q>
                  <p>If any one ſhall ſay, That Biſhops are not Superior to Prieſts, or have not the power of Confirming and Ordaining, or that the power they have is common to them with Prieſts, let him be Anathema.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The Ordainer then muſt of Neceſſity be a Biſhop. This for the <hi>Minor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If there be any difficulty in the matter, it reſpects the <hi>Major:</hi> But I am now to ſhew there is none at all. This then I lay down as evident, except the Ordainer know that he is in Truth what he is called, <hi>viz.</hi> a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, he knows not that his Intention is ſuch as operates in, and is effectual to Ordination, nor conſequently that he makes a true Prieſt. My Medium, you know, points directly at this, and the connexion is unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, according to your ſelves. Which being ſaid, it onely remains that I make out,</p>
               <p>That none of your Biſhops know that they are true Biſhops. I do it thus,</p>
               <q>
                  <p>No Biſhops that are <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertain, whether or no they are true Prieſts, know that they are true Biſhops.</p>
                  <p>But all the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops are uncertain, whether or no they are true Prieſts. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops know that they are true Biſhops.</p>
               </q>
               <p>To verifie the <hi>Major,</hi> I need but ſay, 1. Your Church holds, That no man can be a Biſhop, who is not firſt a Prieſt. A taſt of Authority may ſatisfie for this.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>If any one <hi>(faith Suarez</hi>

                  <p>

                  <p>The Epiſcopate depends on the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; for the making a man Biſhop be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is made Prieſt, would be of no avail.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The Reaſon hereof, is, No man can give that which he hath not himſelf; the Pro-eminent power the Biſhop hath, was eſpecially given him for Conſtituting Prieſts for the Service of the Church; and therefore it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that he have what he confers.</p>

               <p>Though your leſſor Orders may be jump'd over, I am ſure you will not ſay, This can; Which if he want, he hath the Name of Biſhop, and no more. This for the Dependence of the two Orders.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As your Ordainers know not whether they had Prieſtly Orders, ſo they cannot know, for that Reaſon, whether they had Epiſcopal Orders. The Uncertainty of the <hi>former</hi> neceſſarily deſtroys all certainty of the <hi>latter. Thus much for the Major.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Minor</hi> Propoſition, it is largely proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand, viz. <hi>That all</hi> Roman <hi>Biſhops are <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertain, whether or no they be true Prieſts, for want of knowing their Ordainer's Intention.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Premiſſes being ſafe, the Concluſion is ſet beyond all hazard, viz. <hi>No</hi> Roman <hi>Biſhops know that they are true Biſhops:</hi> And conſequently they know not that their <hi>Intending</hi> is available to Ordination.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſing them to know that they were truly made Prieſts, (which yet, as appears, they neither do, nor can know) yet they cannot know that they are true Biſhops, for the ſame Reaſon that Prieſts cannot know that they are true Prieſts, <hi>viz.</hi> Their Ignorance of their Conſecrator's Intention. Biſhops are as far from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50192:50"/>the Hearts of their Conſecrators, as Prieſts are from inſpecting the Hearts of the Biſhops. There is Parity of Reaſon on both ſides.</p>
               <p>I will advance one other Medium, to prove your Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops to be Uncertain of their Orders. I take my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from their Not-knowing that they were indeed Baptized. And I will take your Simple Prieſts along with them for Company. In Form it runs thus,</p>
               <q>
                  <p>No Biſhops or Prieſts, that are uncertain whether or on they were truly Baptized, know whether or no they be <hi>[re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively]</hi> true Biſhops or Prieſts.</p>
                  <p>But all <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops and Prieſts are <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertain, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no they were truly Baptized. <hi>Ergo,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This I have ſaid, is enough to evince the neceſſary dependence Orders have upon Baptiſm, which is the Gate through which your other Sacraments enter; and which being ſhut, they are kept forth.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Second,</hi> I need add nothing to enlighten it: For the aboveſaid dependence being acknowledged, no man hath power to deny, That he who is uncertain that he was Baptized, muſt be ſo that he was Ordained. This for the proof of the <hi>Major.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is this, <hi>All</hi> Roman <hi>Biſhops and Prieſts are <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertain whether or no they were truly Baptized.</hi> But this is proved before-hand, by thoſe Arguments that convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that the Miniſter's Intention is not Knowable by any beſides himſelf.</p>
               <p>Now the Premiſſes being ſted faſt, the concluſion ſtands moſt firm, viz. <hi>No</hi> Roman <hi>Biſhops or Prieſts know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be true Biſhops or Prieſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall not be reckoned to have made ſuperfluous proof of this Point, if the <hi>Reader</hi> ſhall conſider the Fruit it yields, the ſeveral Mediums being ſo many Hammers to break to pieces the pretended Certainty of the <hi>Roman</hi> Prieſthood. If it be born in mind, that the Intention is a Mental contingent Act, which the Agent may, or may not do, at his pleaſure; and that none can diſcover, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he exert that Act, or not, it will be very obvious here to view the ſeveral Grounds of the Uncertainty of their Prieſthood. If the Biſhop was not Baptized with due Intention, he cannot Ordain. If he was not <hi>ſo</hi> made
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:50192:51"/>Prieſt, he cannot Ordain, if he was not <hi>ſo</hi> conſecrated, he cannot Ordain. And it plainly appears that himſelf cannot be certain of any of theſe, and therefore cannot be certain he makes a Prieſt, becauſe all theſe go to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie him for that Work. And the Prieſt, beſides theſe inſuperable uncertainties, common to the Biſhop with him, is vexed with one more as bad as the reſt. He knows not that the Biſhop (if he ſhould chance to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of doing it) intended to communicate Spiritual Power to him.</p>
               <p>So that there are <hi>three</hi> hazards to allay the Biſhop's confidence of his making Prieſts, and a <hi>fourth</hi> more to allay That of the Prieſt.</p>
               <p>But this may be accounted a ſmall thing in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of what follows. The Conſecrator of our preſent Biſhop was liable to the ſame <hi>three</hi> Uncertainties, and theſe are chargeable, in their Effects, upon our Biſhop. If his Ordainer and Conſecrator were not truly Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, made Prieſt, and Biſhop, (and God only knows that) They had no Faculty to Ordain or Conſecrate, and then our Biſhop hath but an empty Name. And the <hi>fourth</hi> comes in too, he knows not what his Conſecrator In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
               <p>So then our Biſhop and his Conſecrator, with reſpect to their Knowledge, whether they ordain Prieſts, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily liable to <hi>Six</hi> Contingencies, any of which fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out will Un biſhop him, and therefore make void his Ordinations.</p>
               <p>Think then how vaſtly theſe Contingences will mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply from the Apoſtles times to ours, and that our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Biſhop is <hi>ſo far</hi> chargeable with any one of the ſaid Omiſſions of Intention, that he hath loſt his Power and Office, if any ſuch hath happen'd in a <hi>direct</hi> deſcent.</p>
               <p>According to the Suggeſtions of common Reaſon, your Maſs-books, and other Books contain Suppoſitions, That there may be defect of due Intention: And Prieſthood
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:50192:52"/>comes down no other way but by a claim of Succeſſion; Intention is neceſſary to hold the links together, and is concerned in the manifold particulars ſpecified; and if any of the links be broken all falls to pieces; No Biſhop or Prieſt afterwards in that particular Line to the worlds end.</p>
               <p>Now I refer it to every inquiſitive man, whether the ground be not too ſlippery for Certainty to ſtand on, amidſt the manifold variety of thoſe contingencies 'fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned.</p>
               <p>Though I allowed you, for Argument ſake, the judgment of Charity for <hi>all</hi> your Biſhops of <hi>this time,</hi> yet ſuppoſing they mean never ſo honeſtly in their Acts, it appears <hi>now</hi> That is not ſufficient to decide the queſtion; for their Intention may be void and ineffectual, though not through want of <hi>Will,</hi> yet for want of <hi>Power.</hi> Their Baptizers or Ordainers may have neglected them, and Theſe upon this ſcore are made uſeleſs to others. The fault may have been committed ſeveral Ages ago, which yet the poor Gentlemen can neither know nor remedy. What room then is there for certainty in this thick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture of hazards?</p>
               <p>We ſhall find that even the dark judgment of Charity will run very low, if we follow the Ordainers up into ſome diſtant Ages, wherein Ignorance and Vice ſtrove, as it were, for maſtery in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. What ſay you of the <hi>9th.</hi> and <hi>10th.</hi> Ages, and the <hi>four</hi> next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, wherein Learning was <hi>generally</hi> fallen aſleep in the Weſtern <hi>Europe,</hi> and wickedneſs as much awake in it? If Hiſtorians of thoſe times may be credited (as they muſt, or <hi>farewel</hi> Authority) great breaches might very probably be made in the Suceſſion of Biſhops in many Sees; for ſuch as are blind and careleſs of their own Souls will hardly be ſure to <hi>look out ſharp,</hi> and be regardful of the Salvation of others, in their Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations.</p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:50192:52"/>
               <p>It ought to be obſerved, With what eaſe and ſpeed Nullities may be diffuſed and multiplied. Let us put a fair caſe, Suppoſe a Biſhop, within whoſe Dioceſe the greateſt Univerſity of a Nation is, ſhould out of unbelief, contempt of Religion, ſupine careleſneſs, or from any other cauſe, omit to Intend as is required, in his frequent Ordinations of the Collegians: it would follow that the Biſhops taken out of theſe Prieſts, though never ſo good men and careful to Intend as they ought, muſt yet act ineffectually, and fill many places with empty names, inſtead of power. The more ſuch, ſo much the worſe; and the longer they live, the bigger is the miſchief. And who can ſecure us againſt this Suppoſition? Now conſidering that Nullities may have at any time thus ſpread, (I ſpeak ſtill with a Relation to your doctrine) and that the farther they go, they grow far more numerous, what can a thoughtful man fin amidſt all this for the certainty of the <hi>Roman</hi> Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood!</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, No man knows on the other hand, that they fail to Intend. I <hi>anſwer,</hi> It is not enough to <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> not to know that they fail, we are to know that they fail not. Knowledge ſtands not in <hi>Negatives,</hi> it is <hi>Poſitives</hi> that ſtay the Underſtanding.</p>
               <p>Give a poſitive Reaſon why they muſt hit the mark, and I ſhall be ſure they cannot miſs it. But none we have found can do this.</p>
               <p>The reſult is, Not one of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, except the Ordaining Biſhops, can know the Intention of the Ordainers. They know it not either in it ſelf, or in its Cauſe, or by any Effects. They are not aſſured of it either by Divine Revelation, or by ſufficient Humane Authority. And therefore they have no true certainty of their Prieſthood which depends upon it. They have not (to uſe your own terms) either a Metaphyſical, or Mathematical, or yet a Moral certainty of it. They
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:50192:53"/>have not (to ſpeak my own language) either Divine or Theological or yet Moral certainty that any one of all the reputed Clergy of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is a true Prieſt.</p>
               <p>For the Ordaining Biſhops, They may indeed know whether themſelves Intend, but know not whether there be any force or virtue in their Intention for making Prieſts, for want of knowing the Intention of the whole Succeſſion of their Baptizers, Ordainers and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crators. So that not one Soul in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath any true certainty of the matter.</p>
               <p>You ſee I have laid the weight of what hath been ſaid, on theſe two grounds: 1. That a Mental inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Intention is required to the very Being of your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, which hath been ſhewn from your own Authors. 2. That Holy Orders is a Sacrament, and ſo as much depends upon the Intention, as any other of them. This I have indeed taken all along for granted; but ſhall now prove it from the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Dubitare nemo poteſt Ordinem eſſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re &amp; proprie unum ex ſeptem Sanctae Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiae Sacra mentis <hi>Seſſ. 23. cap. 7.</hi>

Now you teach that all your Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do ſo depend, except Baptiſm and Matrimony: So then <hi>five</hi> of the <hi>ſeven</hi> are unavoidably uncertain to each of you, by immediate inference from the Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of your Prieſthood.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. Moreover, You are uncertain upon the ſame ground, <hi>viz. your ignorance of the Miniſter's Intention,</hi> of having the <hi>two other,</hi> whether adminiſtred by Prieſts who are the ordinary Miniſters of them, or by others whom neceſſity makes ſuch in the Prieſts abſence.</p>
               <p>Chriſt ſurely inſtituted his Sacraments for great Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Ends, which are as ſurely attained by the worthy partakers of them. How deplorable then is the eſtate of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, ſince not one of its Members knows that in his whole life time he receives any One Sacrament! <hi>this in general.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. I will now infer more particularly, from the Virtue of the Premiſſes already laid down and proved;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Not one Member of your Church can without ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Revelation (which is excepted in the State of our Queſtion) be aſcertained he had the Bleſſing of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Baptiſm, which you hold to be a Sacrament neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to all; and without which your <hi>Trent</hi> Council ſaith, <hi>There is no Salvation</hi>

               <p n="4">§. 4. I know the Canon is generally interpreted thus, An <hi>adult</hi> is Savable by Contrition and the <hi>deſire</hi> of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, if the Miniſter chance to have robbed him of it by Not intending. But behold the miſeries he is yet liable to, notwithſtanding that: (1.) You cannot plead that ſuch a one is capable of any Office purely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the Service of God's Church, (2.) nor that he is capable of the Benefits of any other Sacrament. Sacraments, as I ſaid, were appointed by Chriſt for great Bleſſings to his people, as being not only ſigns, but alſo inſtrumental cauſes of the Grace they ſignifie: and therefore the next to the miſery of wanting them, it is moſt lamentable to be Uncertain whether or no a man indeed has them; which is apparently the Caſe of all <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. But if an Infant dye defrauded of the Baptizer's Intention, (and none can be aſſured that any particular one is not) according to the current of your doctrin he is eternally ſhut out of the Kingdom of Heaven; in as much as he is not capable of making up the defect by Contrition and deſire of Baptiſm. If there be no aſſurance had of the Baptizer's Intention, there can be none had of the Child's Salvation, according to your doctrin. Which muſt make the Funerals of poor Babes far more bitter to their Chriſtian Parents, and Friends, than they would be, had they juſt grounds of ſecurity for their Reigning with Chriſt in Glory.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. 2. No <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick is ſure that after a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of ſins made to his Prieſt, he gains from him a true Sacramental Abſolution.</p>
               <p>As Baptiſm is, with you, neceſſary to all without exception, for taking away Sin, and for the infuſion of Grace; ſo is Penance neceſſary to all them that after Baptiſm have fallen into mortal ſin: and the effects of it are no leſs, ſay you, than Pardon and Reconciliation. This is the only Plank to ſwim ſafe to ſhoar on, after a
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:50192:54"/>moral Shipwrack; without which all ſuch ſink down into the <hi>Abyſs</hi> of Perdition. Well, the more neceſſary you eſteem This to be, and the more valuable its Effects, the more comfort would proportionably fall to your ſhare, if you were ſure you had it. But on the contrary it will be your miſery not to know you are inriched with that treaſure. When you have come to the Prieſt Contrite, and opened all your ſins to him without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and are diſpoſed to ſatisfie for all injuries done by you, it is a mournful thing, after all this, to come away Uncertain of your being indeed Abſolved, for want of Knowledge that the Prieſt could Effectually, and did Actually Intend to Releaſe you of your ſins. <hi>Which is the ſad caſe of every</hi> Roman <hi>Catholick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. 3. No <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick is certain that he at any time receives the Sacrament of the Euchariſt</p>
               <p>Though you make not This altogether ſo neceſſary, as you do Baptiſm and Penance, yet you hold it to be matter of great advantage to the Soul. The Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Body of Chriſt, <hi>you ſay,</hi> is received there, and with, and by it Spiritual Nouriſhment, whereby the Graces of the Spirit are ſuſtained and increaſed; and the Soul conſequently made more vigorous for performing all Chriſtian duty. Now the more excellent the Effects of this Sacrament are known to be, the greater comfort it is apt to yield to all that are certain they receive it, and do this, as they hope, Worthily. But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, how doleful is it to be uncertain (how great ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their preparations have been for it) whether they at any time truly have it, for want of Knowing that the Prieſt could Effectually and did Actually Intend to Conſecrate, without which the Elements remain Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified, and cannot be Vehicles of thoſe Bleſſings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by Chriſt to be communicated that way to the Soul. <hi>And yet this is the ſad caſe of</hi> Roman <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:50192:55"/>
               <p n="8">§. 8. It remains that I add, you are not only unhappy in not knowing This, with reſpect to the foreſaid Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings to be received by it; But alſo with reſpect to two great Duties (as you count them) to be done, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Conſecration. One is the Adoration of the Hoſt; the other the Offering it as a Sacrifice both for the quick and dead. If your Church do both theſe on Uncertain grounds, it will look a very ſad thing: And that ſhe doth ſo, will be inferred from what hath been already proved, Conſecration it ſelf, which alone can be ſuppoſed to ſupport them, being found to be an Uncertain thing. That nothing may remain obſcure, touching theſe matters, I ſhall take room enough to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain them.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Firſt,</hi> viz. Adoration of the Hoſt; The <hi>Trent</hi>-Council delivers this Doctrine to warrant the practice of it:</p>
               <p>There is no place left for doubt, but all the faithful of <hi>Chriſt</hi> may exhibite Adoration, which is due to the true God, to this moſt Holy Sacrament, in their Veneration of it.<note n="*" place="margin">Nullus dubitandi locus relinqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, quin omnes Chriſti fideles— la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triae cultum qui vero Dco debetur, buic ſanctiſſimo Sacramento in veneratione exhibcant. <hi>Seſſ. 13. cap. 5.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>And the Council there ſubjoins, that the Cuſtome was piouſly and religiouſly brought into the Church, of Yearly ſetting a Day apart, for carrying the Sacrament in Solemn Proceſſion, through frequented Ways and publick Places, in order to its being Adored, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is too well known to be inſiſted on, that aſſoon as the Prieſt hath conſecrated, he pays to the Sacrament the Worſhip that belongeth to God alone; and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple preſent, upon the Uſual Notice given them, do the ſame: And that in the moſt populous Towns of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Communion, when it is carried through the Streets to any Sick perſon, under a Canopy, all that meet it fall down and adore it.</p>
               <p n="9">§. 9. I have ſaid all this, to evince that the Adoration
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:50192:55"/>ſpoken of, hath not for its Object our Bleſſed Saviour conſidered as corporally preſent in Heaven, but as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent under the <hi>Species</hi> of Bread or Wine; or both. It is the Sacrament that is to be Adored, your Council and practice tell us. But now the Body is no Sacrament with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>Species,</hi> for there would be wanting in that caſe a Viſible Sign, which is the <hi>Genus</hi> of a Sacrament. This Point being fixt, I come to ask, What if there happen to be no true Conſecration, when the Exterior Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Action is done, which is a thing you all grant may happen?</p>
               <p n="10">§. 10. Why, the ſame Adoration is paid ſtill, upon a preſumption of true Conſecration. If I ask again, What is adored in that caſe? It muſt be anſwered, a Creature, <hi>viz. the Bread,</hi> is adored inſtead of God.</p>
               <p>And then this is in one ſenſe or another, Idolatry.</p>
               <p>It follows alſo, upon the ſame ground, That when men are Uncertain whether there be true Conſecration, they are alſo uncertain whether they commit not Idolatry in ſuch their Adorations.</p>
               <p>Now I conclude, that <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks are at no time certain, that they commit not Idolatry in Worſhipping the Hoſt.</p>
               <p>I add, God is very jealous of his Honour, and Men ſhould be tender of it too; and therefore I would think they ſhould have either ſimple Evidence or Revelation for the Divinity of the Object, before they pay to it that greateſt Tribute of Adoration: But <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks light far ſhort of that Certainty of the matter, and yet venture to adore, hit or miſs.</p>
               <p n="11">§. 11. For the <hi>Second:</hi> The Euchariſt, according to you, is a proper Sacrifice: That is, the Body and Blood of Chriſt, are by the Prieſt truly and properly offered to God in the Maſs, under the viſible <hi>Species</hi> of Bread and Wine: And this is a Propitiatory Sacrifice. God being pleaſed with this Oblation, grants to thoſe, for whom it
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:50192:56"/>is Offered, Grace, Repentance, Remiſſion of many and grievous Sins, and Supplies for their ſeveral Neceſſities. Nor doth this profit Men alive onely, but after Death. <hi>Thus your Church teaches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I cannot but acknowledge that this Doctrine is belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved among you, for I find that moſt Men of Eſtates in your Communion, do at their Death leave good round Sums of Mony to certain Prieſts, who in conſideration of it, are to ſhorten their Benefactors ſtay in the acute pains of Purgatory, by ſaying of Maſſes, or Offering this Sacrifice in their behalf. And if this Doctrine be true, the Service done them is worth their Mony; which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be better employed otherwiſe.</p>
               <p n="12">§. 12. But if there be no Conſecration made by thoſe reſpective Prieſts, who promiſe to help them by that Means, there will be a great diſappointment ſomewhere. But I ſhall ſay no more of that. However, this I may ſay, (having laid down a Warrant for it) that neither Prieſts nor People are certain, that there will be a return of Maſſes for the Mony, as not knowing whether they be true Prieſts, and ſo (intend how they will) capable of turning the Bread and Wine into the Body and Blood of Chriſt, which are the ſuppoſed Matter of that Sacrifice. <hi>In this condition are all</hi> Roman <hi>Catholicks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, Sir, ſuppoſing, for Argument-ſake, your Doctrin of Tranſubſtantiation to be true, (though I profeſs, it was never in my power to believe it) the ſundry things I have here alledged, do nevertheleſs hold good againſt you.</p>
               <p n="13">§. 13. 4. No <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick is ſure that he ever par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of your other Sacraments, not yet particularly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by me, as Confirmation and extreme Unction, as not knowing whether the Miniſters of them could ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, and did actually Intend in the Adminiſtration of them. Without which, as I have often ſhewed, there is no Sacrament. Being almoſt weary of enlarging on particulars, I have put theſe together.</p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:50192:56"/>
               <p>Number and deſcribe all the great Effects you can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to them, (and in any thing of this kind I will grant your Suppoſition, for argument-ſake, as I have all along in theſe Papers) and after you have done this you will find, that no <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick is fure he ſhares in any one of them, for the Reaſons often alledged before. Biſhops, Prieſts, and all other Members of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion are wrapt up in an inextricable Uncertainty.</p>
               <p n="14">§. 14. All I can honeſtly (to the beſt of my Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) grant you, according to your Principles laid down, is this, That the Miniſters of Baptiſm know that thoſe they have Baptized are partakers of that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I mean it only of Infants, who could not put in a bar againſt the Efficacy of it. But yet neither the ſaid Miniſters nor any other of your Body knows that himſelf was Baptized, as not Knowing how he intended who Baptized him. So that what I inferred ſtands firm, <hi>viz.</hi> that not one of you knows that he doth or hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any one of your Sacraments.</p>
               <p n="15">
                  <hi>§.</hi> 15. I advertiſe, This is it which makes the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in this reſpect between the Miniſters of Baptiſm and thoſe of your other Sacraments, treated of before, Thoſe need no ſpecial character to qualifie them for that work. Any man or woman, whether <hi>Jew, Heathen,</hi> or <hi>Turk,</hi> may Baptize with Effect, provided they Intend to do what the Church doth; <hi>according to your doctrin:</hi> Whereas the Miniſters of the other Sacraments (Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony excepted) muſt have ſpecial power and authority from Chriſt to Adminiſter, or elſe they Act in vain. And though Matrimony depend not (to ſpeak your language) on the Prieſtly character, the parties Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying being the proper Miniſters of that Sacrament; yet I cannot grant them the ſame Certitude with the Miniſters of Baptiſm, becauſe Two muſt there Intend alike, or nothing is done; and neither of them can be ſure judges ſave of their own reſpective Intention.</p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:50192:57"/>
               <p>That they make a civil Contract to lead an indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual life plainly appears, when he ſaith, <hi>I take thee for my Wife:</hi> and ſhe, <hi>I take thee for my Husband.</hi> But whether both parties alſo Intend to make thoſe Words ſignifie the ſacred Conjunction of Chriſt with his Church, (in a general or ſpecial Senſe, in a more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct or confuſed) and thereby to obtain Grace, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not appear to either party. The man can be ſure but for himſelf, nor can the woman but for her ſelf.</p>
               <p n="16">§. 16. Here is to be noted, when I make the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting parties Miniſters of Matrimony, I follow only the greater part of your Authors. Where you vary, I cannot repreſent you as agreed. But for thoſe that make a Prieſt the Miniſter of it, they are not a whit the nearer Certainty, becauſe they know not his Intention.</p>
               <p>Before I move forward, I ſhall re-mind the Reader that the Inferences hitherto drawn ſpeak forth miſery to <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks on theſe two grounds, put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. (1.) There is no <hi>Sacramental Grace</hi> conveyed, where there are no <hi>true Sacraments.</hi> The Terms are eſſentially Relative. (2.) There is an equal Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the Sacraments, and of the fruits of them.</p>
               <p>Now I ſay, each <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick, for ought he can know, wants the Sacraments, and by conſequence their Effects; and if he have them, he yet wants the comfort of Knowing it. Which makes the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in a ſad condition.</p>
               <p>Sir, When you have conſidered what hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid, I would commend a few Inferences more to the exerciſe of your thoughts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 17. 1. If none of you can know that any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar man in your Church is a true Biſhop or Prieſt, (which is proved) it follows that the Jeſuits, who lay ſo much weight upon the Papal Chair, cannot know the Pope to be ſo much as a Prieſt, nor conſequently that he is an Infallible Judge of Faith.</p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:50192:57"/>
               <p>Thoſe they account Succeſſors of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in the Univerſal Paſtorſhip of the Church (to whom they appropriate ſpecial Priviledges, and particularly that of Infallibility) are not to be Lay-men ſure, but ſuch as have the Sacerdotal Character. But ſince no man alive (as is proved) is ſure according to your doctrin, that any particular man is Prieſt, no man is ſure the Pope is ſuch, and conſequently that he is an Infallible Judge of Controverſies.</p>
               <p>The Intention of him who Baptized and Ordained the Pope, and the capacity of his Ordainer were, and ever will be hidden things: and hence ſprings the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty.</p>
               <p n="18">§. 18. 2. Now a word to thoſe called the <hi>Pariſian</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines. If you cannot know that any particular men are true Biſhops or Prieſts, you cannot know that any of your <hi>Roman</hi> Councils have defined Infallible Truth, in as much as your ſelves hold that the promiſe of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Aſſiſtance, by which alone they can be ſuppoſed to be preſerved inerrable, is not made to any Aſſemblies but ſuch as conſiſt of men in Holy Orders.</p>
               <p>You are indeed content that Lay-men be preſent there, and act in a certain inferior Sphere, <hi>viz.</hi> That they aſſiſt in examining difficulties, conſult, debate, approve, protect, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But to none of them do you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the power of Determination or Deciſion. Thoſe Synods then, as your ſelves hold, are to be made up of Biſhops, or Prieſts, or both.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe it cannot be known that theſe ever had Prieſtly Orders, for want of Knowledge that they were truly Baptized and Ordained, you muſt be Uncertain whether ſuch were true Councils, and conſequently whether they decreed and defined Infallible Faith.</p>
               <p>Although you may have ſome true Prieſts in general, yet in regard you are uncertain who they are, How know you that the major part of ſuch Councils, <hi>ex. gr.</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:50192:58"/>that of <hi>Trent,</hi> were true Prieſts and conſequently ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of making Infallible determinations? I will ſpeak a leſs word, How know you that the <hi>4th</hi> part <hi>there</hi> were ſuch? You might have a true Clergy, I ſay, and yet it is poſſible that few or none of them might be in that Synod. For the Clergy in a Council uſually bears but a very ſmall proportion, for number, to the reſt. Many of <hi>theſe</hi> may poſſibly have true Orders, when moſt of the Members of ſuch a Council want them. Unleſs you know both the capacity and Intention of thoſe who Baptized and Ordained ſuch Members, you are not (as hath been proved) aſſured they were Biſhops or Prieſts; and conſequently that the Holy Ghoſt aſſiſted them in their work.</p>
               <p>If ſending men to a Council will indeed by <hi>Poſt-fact</hi> juſtifie mens Baptiſm and Orders, it were well worth the while (whatever it coſt) to have as frequent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils as poſſible; and to ſend numerous flocks of the Clergy thither to ſtay one Seſſion, to be ſucceeded ſtill by more, till the Uncertainty of the Baptiſm and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of moſt of the Biſhops and Prieſts be removed. But I think my ſelf the <hi>firſt</hi> that ever ſpoke of this Cure for this Diſeaſe, and therefore think it will never be plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt me by my Adverſaries. However, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper remains till ſome Remedy be found out, you know not that the Members of your Council are true Prieſts, and ſo intereſſed in the promiſe of Divine Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and ſo capable of making <hi>infalltble</hi> deciſions.</p>
               <p n="19">
                  <hi>§.</hi> 19. 3. For thoſe that hold Pope and Council, when conjoyned, to be Infallible, I ſay but this to them, Neither Pope nor Council will be more ſurely proved to have had Baptiſm and Orders, when they are toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than when they are a-ſunder; that is, it cannot be proved at all, if the <hi>Roman</hi> doctrin by me exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted be true: and then they can hardly be thought to be Infallible Determiners of Faith.</p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:50192:58"/>
               <p n="20">
                  <hi>§.</hi> 20. 4. If no <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick can know that any particular man of theirs is a true Prieſt, then the boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Argument taken from the Un-interrupted Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Lawful Paſtors in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, is of no force, till they can be ſure of the Intention of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Baptizers of every Pope, and that every Pope from the Apoſtles days hitherto was Ordained by ſuch as were capable of giving them Orders, and Intended to do it in each reſpective Ordination, (which, as I have evinced, can never be known) their Succeſſion reſts but upon bare preſumption without proof, and therefore amounts not to a cogent Argument.</p>
               <p>Thus have I, as I think, accompliſh't my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, not leaving one Member of the <hi>Roman</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion certain that there is among them any one true Prieſt <hi>in particular,</hi> nor any Sacraments <hi>in particular,</hi> given or received in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: and all this from the Medium I laid down at firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> your doctrin of the Intention.</p>
               <p n="21">
                  <hi>§.</hi> 21. Now I think fit to re-mind the Reader, that to do This (1.) I have explicated the Terms from <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Catholick Authors. (2.) I have taken <hi>their</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines for the grounds of my Inferences: nor have I in Order to any part of my work, needed to ruffle or quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel any of their Notions, otherwiſe than my mere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions from their Principles will do it. It is all one to me if they would make Seventy inſtead of Seven Sacraments, provided I prove they are not certain of their Giving and Receiving them. It is all one to me if they ſhould make each Biſhop of their Church as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falllible as the Jeſuits make the Pope; and every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Council as Infallible as they do thoſe they call General, provided I prove they cannot be ſure that thoſe Biſhops, or Members of Councils are in Holy Orders, and thereby capable of that power of Deciſion or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, which they would attribute to them.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:50192:59"/>None then ought to wonder, that I ſpeak their language, without croſſing ſeveral Principles of theirs, which I have occaſion to mention, ſince it hath been my only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to render all their things looſe and uncertain from their own Doctrine.</p>
               <p n="22">§. 22. If it be ſaid, I have proved ſome things which <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks deny not. I anſwer, (1.) The worſt that will follow hence, is, There is a little labour loſt. (2.) It may be of ſome advantage to the Truth to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh That among the Vulgar, which though the more learned <hi>Romaniſts</hi> cannot deny, yet they would gladly bury in ſilence. This Article of the Intention, I believe to be one of that kind.</p>
               <p>For want of repreſenting This honeſtly and generally, the Credulity of Perſons of both Perſwaſions is apt to be abuſed.</p>
               <p n="23">§. 23. 1. Not a few of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> are liable to be filled with an ungrounded Confidence, that Sacramental Grace ever attends the performance of the exterior Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental Actions. One of that ſort I can name, who upon receiving an Abſolution from his Confeſſor, came forth of his Houſe, and leapt up for joy, and told ſome judicious Proteſtants, (who were occaſionally before his Door) That he was then as free from Sin, as is an Infant newly Baptized.</p>
               <p>Had this Man known and conſidered the Truth I have here ſifted out, he would either have been modeſtly ſilent, or tempered his Speech with theſe Conditions, If I be a true Penitent, and if my Confeſſor be a true Prieſt, and be thereby capable of Abſolving me, and alſo did I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to do it, then am I freed from Sin. But I fear moſt of your Laity entertain the like confidence, bottomed upon the like Ignorance.</p>
               <p n="24">§. 24. 2. The vulgar People of our Communion, for want of skill in this Point, are more obnoxious to the Snares of your Prieſts, who tell them they both can, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:50192:59"/>will forgive them their Sins, if they will come into the Boſom of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and confeſs them. Now the Conſcience being afraid of nothing, but Sin, a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent promiſe of Remiſſion is oft hearkened to readily, and with ſome pleaſure, even when there is nothing ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to warrant it.</p>
               <p>Whereas, if all our People knew, that thoſe ſtout Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſers could never prove, that themſelves were truly Ordained, nor conſequently Authorized to forgive Sin; nor ſo much as that themſelves were ever Sacramentally Abſolved from any one of their Sins, (all which I have proved.) They [our people] would ſmile at their Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and bid them go find out a way for their own ſafety.</p>
               <p n="25">§. 25. The Concluſion is, My true Repreſentation of Things, to ſuch as have not had the opportunity to know them before, may excuſe my inſiſting upon ſome few things, which perhaps may not be denied by <hi>Roman</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, when they are ſqueez'd to a Declaration of the Truth.</p>

                  <hi>SECT. IX.</hi> The Banks Mr. G. hath cast up to ſecure the <hi>Roman</hi> Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, taken in general, cast down.</head>
               <p>SIR, I had, together with the laſt Section, ended all the trouble I purpoſed to give You, had you not by your way of Anſwer drawn me ſomewhat farther. I have ſaid more than once, I thought it Manifeſtation enough of the weak Eſtate of your Church, to prove her Uncertain, whether ſhe have any true Prieſts or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments <hi>in particular.</hi> And I leave it to the judgment of the diſcerning Reader, whether I have not effected that, by ſhewing the Uncertainty both of the Biſhop's Intention, conſidered in it ſelf, and alſo of the Validity
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:50192:60"/>of it, in caſe he doth Intend. But becauſe you would have more, you ſhall.</p>
               <p n="1">§. 1. And this <hi>more</hi> ſhall be chiefly to caſt down or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh the Bulwarks, you have caſt up for the Security of the Biſhop's Intention, in order to the Defence of your Prieſthood <hi>in general.</hi> And truly this is all, that in ſtrictneſs can be required of one that Undertakes to prove a Negative. What he does more, may well be accounted Surpluſage.</p>
               <p>Having premiſed this, I ſhall again ſet down your Diſtinction in your own words, and then try what ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency it hath to the End you bring it for.</p>
               <q>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>§. 2.</hi> You muſt give me leave, <hi>ſay you,</hi> to diſtinguiſh in the major Propoſition of the former Syllogiſm, between that knowledge which is obtained by the Obſervation of exterior Actions and Geſtures, and attention to the words of the Prelates in any particular Ordinations; and that knowledge which we have from the Conſideration of the Nature and end of Ordination in general, and which is alſo neceſſarily dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from other known Principles of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Church grounded upon Divine Revelation.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, if you underſtand by <hi>knowing</hi> here, knowing in the former way onely, which you ſeem to me to do, I deny this your firſt Propoſition to be true. For ſuppoſing (not granting) that the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Church doth make Prieſtly Ordination to depend upon a Condition, that no man living knows in the former way (<hi>viz.</hi> by obſerving onely what is outwardly done, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) whether it be fulfill'd or no, yet it doth not follow, that ſhe muſt be uncertain, whether ſhe hath any true Prieſthood, becauſe others, beſides the Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prelates, know that ſhe hath true Prieſthood by the ſecond way of Knowledge above-mentioned; that is, from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and End of the Thing, and neceſſary deduction from other true Principles. <hi>Thus far you.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p n="3">§. 3. I ſhall now examine this diſtinction, taking in your Explication of it, and try how far it may beſtead You.</p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:50192:60"/>
               <p>To gain an opportunity of making a diſtinction, and applying it with ſome ſhew of pertinence, you ſeem to fancy my ſenſe of the matter to be this, <hi>viz.</hi> The Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainer's Intention cannot indeed be known by obſerving his exterior Action and Geſture in his particular Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, but it may be known ſome other way. What elſe do theſe words of yours ſignifie, viz. <hi>If you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,</hi> ſay you, <hi>by knowing here, knowing in the former way onely, which you ſeem to me to do,</hi> &amp;c. This, Sir, is a ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs conceit, hatcht on purpoſe, I think, to ſerve a turn. For, as to your Ordinations <hi>in particular,</hi> upon which your Prieſts <hi>in particular</hi> depend for their Being, (which it was my only aim to deal with) I have denied that the Biſhop's Intention in them can <hi>any</hi> way be known, and have made my denial good. If then you apply both the Members of your diſtinction, with a reſpect to this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Terms, you pronounce my Propoſition falſe, upon a figment of your own brain, which yet you would father on me, though I never gave you the leaſt temptation to entertain it. But if you make the latter Member of your diſtinction, not to reſpect the Thing conſidered <hi>in particular,</hi> but onely <hi>in general,</hi> then (1.) It is not applied <hi>ad idem,</hi> and therefore gives you no relief againſt my declared deſign. (2.) If it only reſpect (I ſay) the Ordainer's Intention <hi>in general,</hi> I deny that it can be known <hi>infallibly</hi> either of theſe ways, or any other what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever: And then there is no room here for your Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. It remains then that theſe Words in my Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition — <hi>a Condition which no man living knows,</hi> &amp;c. are abſolutely Negative, with reſpect and proportion to the State of the Queſtion laid down before.</p>
               <p>Which ſtate had you called for, before you gave an Anſwer, your Things would have been no leſs pertinent.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. As you have without cauſe made me think what beſt liketh you, ſo you are too oft leaving the thred of my Argument, which yet you are altogether to keep to,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:50192:61"/>if you will be pertinent. I expected you would (as you ſhould) have ſpoken here with a formal relation to my Propoſition, which is this, <hi>all Churches that make Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ordination depend upon a Condition which no man living knows whether it be fulfill'd, muſt be <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertain whether they have any true Prieſthood.</hi> Hence it evidently appears it was my direct buſineſs to prove you uncertain of your Prieſthood from your Uncertainty of the performance of a Condition required to Ordination: and you did not, could not deny the firm Connexion of the <hi>Medium</hi> with the <hi>Extream.</hi> Let us ſee now how you order your Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. You diſtinguiſh of <hi>Knowing</hi> without mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for ſome time, any object of that Knowledge: which you ſhould have ſupplied thus, I diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Knowing of a Condition required to Ordination,</hi> &amp;c. Then though you mention a Condition, yet you do not keep to it, but forthwith as it were forgetting it, run from it to Prieſthood it ſelf; that is, you run away from the conſideration of a Sacrament to the <hi>[res Sacramenti]</hi> Effect of it. Your words are theſe — <hi>Suppoſing the</hi> Roman <hi>Catholick Church makes Prieſtly Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to depend upon a Condition that no man living — knows in the former way — whether it be fulfill'd or no, yet it doth not follow She muſt be <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertain whether ſhe hath any true Prieſthood.</hi> This is true if the Condition can be known to be fulfill'd any other way: but it is imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in this place, for it ſhould have been thus ſaid— <hi>Yet it doth not follow ſhe muſt be uncertain whether the ſaid Condition be fulfill'd or no.</hi> Or, <hi>if it may not be known that way, yet it may be known another.</hi> Here then is a manifeſt ſliding from the Condition required to Ordination (which I afterwards made to be the Ordainer's Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) to the Prieſthood.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. Now had I in my Reply groſly ſwallowed this <hi>Gulgeon,</hi> and ſubmitted my ſelf to deal about the proof
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:50192:61"/>of the <hi>Roman</hi> Prieſthood in an indefinite unlimited manner, I muſt have loſt my preſent Argument which preciſely depends upon the incapacity of all men to know another man's Intention. But know, Sir, your Anſwer is no Anſwer to me, farther than you ſpeak relatively to my Argument: and though you ſeem wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſlink away from a Condition to Ordination to Prieſthood, the Effects of it; which you would find ſome plauſible way to maintain, if you could ſhake off my Medium, yet I will ſurely keep you to it. It is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, <hi>ad hominem,</hi> I grant, but it will bite you ſorely.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. Here I ſhall take occaſion to advertiſe the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that though an Argument <hi>ad hominem</hi> be in many caſes leſs conſiderable, yet in mine who argue againſt <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks from their eſtabliſhed doctrin, it hath as much Virtue and Cogency againſt them as if I made my Inferences from the <hi>four</hi> Goſpels, or the Divine Epiſtles. For they hold the voice of their Church in their Councils of <hi>Florence, Trent, &amp;c.</hi> to have the ſame Obligation upon Conſcience that thoſe Goſpels and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles have. If my deductions be good, they muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grant the whole to their great loſs, or by denying the Principles I go upon, looſe and undo the whole frame of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>Other Churches that aſſume not Infallibility, in ſuch a caſe, part only with a particular Tenet, the reſt of their frame ſtanding as it did before; but <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks who attribute un errableneſs to their Church (on which pretended ground their preſent Fabrick ſtands) utterly ruin their whole Building, if they grant their Councils to have been miſtaken in any one Article they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined for Faith.</p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. Now I come to the Matter your Words preſent us with, for aſcertaining the required Intention of your Ordaining Biſhops, conſidered (I ſuppoſe you mean) in general.</p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:50192:62"/>
               <p>As your Words ſeem to run at firſt ſight, you lay down two Grounds for this. 1. The Nature and End of Ordination in general. 2. Deductions from other known Principles of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Church. I ſhall conſider both theſe.</p>
               <p n="9">§. 9. For the <hi>firſt,</hi> I know indeed that every Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſets forth the Nature of what is to be obſerved, and the Ends they are appointed for, are notified by the Inſtitutor: but I never learned that Inſtitutions carry power in them to cauſe themſelves to be obſerved. The Churches named in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> which long ſince periſhed, (theſe and others) once had all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Inſtitutions, but in proceſs of time loſt or left them, what proof then is the Nature and End of Ordination of its true Exiſtence, or due performance in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church?</p>
               <p>But if you intended the <hi>Two</hi> I mentioned to be but <hi>one</hi> Ground-work by their conjunction, ſo that the Senſe is this, The Nature and End of Ordination in general, in Union or together with Deductions from other known Principles of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I am well content, as not being inclined to make any man's words (howſoever put) to ſignifie what their ſpeaker or writer meant not. And I confeſs ſome of your own words perſwade me they look this way. I ſhall therefore conſider them together under the next parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
               <p n="10">§. 10. For the <hi>ſecond.</hi> You tell of the Biſhop's Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be Knowable by way of Deduction from ſome known Principles of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, grounded upon divine Revelation. The Reader may mark, you do not ſay, This Knowledge is immediately deducible from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation, but from ſome Principles <hi>grounded on it.</hi> For ought I ſee by this, you are not <hi>agreed</hi> to claim an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible certainty of the Intention of your Ordaining Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, even conſidered <hi>in general;</hi> that is, that there are
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:50192:62"/>any at all in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church that exert the <hi>required</hi> Intention. And yet without this, we have found there is no Ordination, and ſo no Prieſt, nor any of thoſe 5. Sacraments that you conſent to ſay depend on the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly character, or laſtly, that your Church is a true Church; which yet is leſs than an <hi>Infallible</hi> Church. Deductions are but the work of Reaſon, and Reaſon is but a fallible Principle, ſay many of you.</p>
               <p>The dependence of all the links of this Chain hath been made good before, ſave the laſt, which is this, where there is no true Prieſthood there is no true Church: Where there is no Infallible Certainty of the Being of a Prieſthood, there is is no Infallible Certainty of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Church. To confirm this I need but ſay little.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> lays down this diſtinction. A thing may two manner of ways be called <hi>neceſſary</hi> in reſpect of an End: 1. When the End cannot be had without it: as Meat is neceſſary to ſuſtain man's life. And this is ſimply neceſſary to an End. 2. When the End cannot ſo conveniently be obtained without it: as a Horſe is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for a journey. But this is not ſimply neceſſary to an End.</p>
               <p>This being premiſed for the clearer Reſolution of the Caſe in hand, he adds,</p>
               <q>
                  <p>There are three Sacraments neceſſary by the firſt way of Neceſſity; two to particular perſons, <hi>viz.</hi> Baptiſm ſimply and abſolutely, and Penance upon ſuppoſition of mortal ſin committed after Baptiſm. But the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Order is [<hi>viz.</hi> ſimply] neceſſary to the Church. But other Sacraments are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary by the ſecond manner of neceſſity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Primo igitur modo neceſſitatis ſunt tria Sacramenta neceſſaria; duo quidem perſonae ſingulari: baptiſmus quidem ſimpliciter &amp; abſolutè, poenitentia autem ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſito peccato mortali poſt baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum. Sacramentum autem Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinis eſt neceſſarium Eccleſie. Sed ſecundo modo neceſſaria ſunt alia Sacramenta, <hi>&amp;c. Sum. Theol. par. 3. q. 65. art. 4.</hi>
                     </note>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>Nor have any of his Commentators, that I have met with, excepted againſt This, nor any others of your Church. Your ſelf a little beneath grants the point, where you ſay with relation hereunto, <hi>The means are
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:50192:63"/>neceſſary to the end.</hi> Several of your men, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in particular<note n="*" place="margin">De Clericis, <hi>cap. 3.</hi>
                  </note>, contend that Proteſtant Churches are no true Churches, becauſe as they alledge they want a true Prieſthood. Beſides, enough is to be fetcht for this purpoſe out of your <hi>Trent</hi> Council<note n="|" place="margin">Seſſ. <hi>23</hi> de Sacram. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinis.</note>, but it is needleſs to do it.</p>
               <p n="11">§. 11. From hence then I preſent you with this <hi>Scheme</hi> founded on your own Authority, you are no ſurer you have a true Church, than you are that you have a true Prieſthood; you are no ſurer that you have a true Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, even taken <hi>in general,</hi> than you are that you have true Ordination; you are not ſurer that you have true Ordination, than you are that your Ordaining Biſhops Intend as your Church requires. Now in regard you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree not to claim for the Intention, the Infallible Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Faith which immediately depends upon divine Revelation, I ſee not how you can reaſonably agree to claim the Infallible Certainty of Faith for the truth of your Church. Which I commend to the Reader's obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p n="12">§. 12. You firſt tell us in general of ſome Known Principles of your Church from which the Knowledge of the Intention is deducible, and afterwards reckon them to be theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Roman</hi> is the only Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church; That God will continue and preſerve that Church to the Worlds end: and all this, <hi>ſay you,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from divine Revelation. You conclude hence they muſt have a true Prieſthood, the Means being neceſſary to the End.</p>
               <p>Therefore, <hi>ſay you,</hi> whatſoever Intention of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates is by them believed as Neceſſary for this End, they do certainly believe according to their Principles that God's Providence will ſecure it; his Omnipotence is able to make good his Fidelity.</p>
               <p n="13">§. 13. <hi>For reply,</hi> 1. I obſerve to the Reader, That though you have preſented us with a liſt of thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:50192:63"/>from which you pretend to deduce the Knowledge of the Ordainer's Intention, yet you only <hi>ſay,</hi> They appear from Divine Revelation, without ſhewing either what this Revelation is, or where it is to be found.</p>
               <p n="14">§. 14. 2. As our diſcourſe was at firſt Perſonal, every one will conceive, that if your thoughts had then enabled you to make the above-named diſtinction, I muſt have asked, What the Revelation was and where it appeared, on which your ſaid Principles are pretended to reſt: Nor could you have refuſed to ſatisfie my Queſtion, without bringing a Cloud upon the Cauſe you manage.</p>
               <p>And you may eaſily believe, that if I had known what you had been writing at <hi>London,</hi> I ſhould have wiſht you would have ſet down What and Where the Revelation you ſpeak of, is; that ſo I might have conſented with you, or refuted you, according to the beſt judgment I could make of the Thing exhibited. I aſſure you, Sir, to obtrude upon the World, Doctrines, under the Notion of Articles of Faith, without due proof of their Divine Original, is too great an Empire for Creatures to arrogate to themſelves; nor can one reaſonably ſubmit to another in ſuch caſes, whether they reſpect God's honour, or their own ſafety. Therefore when you talk of Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, you ſhould have ſhewed it.</p>
               <p n="15">§. 15. You would ſurely enroll me in the Catalogue of Franticks, if I ſhould upon this Occaſion ſpend Years in hunting through all Books for Texts of Scripture, which your Popes, or their Subjects have fancied to be uſeful for proving the <hi>Roman</hi> to be the Univerſal Church, and in confuting their vain Gloſſes, when I have ſound them. Your Perſon is not adverſe to me, but your Cauſe; and therefore you leave the Field, and ceaſe to be my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, unleſs you ſhew me your places of defence, and wherein their ſtrength lies, and then defy my Aſſaults. But this is not done here.</p>
               <p>Tell me, is the Revelation you ſpeak of, recorded in the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:50192:64"/>firſt <hi>Verſe, or</hi> Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> or the laſt Verſe of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> or in any <hi>Verſe</hi> between thoſe. Have you not read that Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the <hi>VIII.</hi> proved the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the ſole Head of the Chriſtian Church (with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-to which Head you call yours the <hi>One</hi> and the <hi>Whole</hi> Church) out of the firſt <hi>Verſe</hi> of <hi>Geneſis, In the beginning God created,</hi> &amp;c. He collected the Argument thus, <hi>Dici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur in principio non in principiis,</hi> &amp;c. It is ſaid, quoth that Pope, in the <hi>Beginning;</hi> not, in the <hi>Beginnings,</hi> &amp;c. And this is urged to prove, that there muſt be One viſible Head of the Church, and <hi>this</hi> the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> with whom all Chriſtians muſt believe, and to whom all muſt ſubmit. Have you not read how Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>VII.</hi> a great while before that, fetcht a proof for the Point, out of the <hi>16th. Verſe</hi> of that Chapter, <hi>God made two great lights, the greater light to rule the day,</hi> &amp;c. —<hi>Illa [dignitas] quae praeeſt diebus, id eſt Spiritualibus, Major eſt.</hi> That is, — That Dignity that rules the <hi>Days,</hi> that is <hi>Spirituals,</hi> is greater. I ſhall omit the compariſon between Popes and Kings, which this Text is brought to ſettle, and only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it to the Point in hand;</p>
               <p>That God made the Pope to Rule all Chriſtians, is all that I ſhall take Notice of, as proved by it.</p>
               <p>I have brought theſe two <hi>infallible</hi> Interpreters of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture upon the Stage, (and which of you ſhould be ſuch, if your <hi>Popes</hi> be not) only to ſhew it would be endleſs to ſeek out thoſe many Texts ſuppoſed by <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks to tend to make out, that the <hi>Roman</hi> is the One Catholick Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> upon Earth, and to expoſe their extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Miſ-expoſitions of them. I might ſoon begin with <hi>Geneſis,</hi> but might be long before I had run through the Bible. If theſe two Popes had ſpoken onely in general words, as you do, of Divine Revelation for their Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, (on which your Matter vertually depends) I am ſo dull, I ſhould never, unleſs by chance, have found out what Scriptures they referred to for it: And ſo, though I had
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:50192:64"/>diſcuſſed a hundred other Texts, if thoſe had been left out, it might have been ſaid, I had left my work undone. But wiſe Men will not judge I ought to undertake Unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able tasks, or ſeek a Needle in a Bottle of Hay.</p>
               <p>But I ſpend time: For, it had been enough to ſay, I am only proving a Negative, and need do no more than over-turn what you are pleaſed to erect for your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. You have ſet me no more work here than I have conſidered, and ſo I have no more to do here about your <hi>divine Revelation,</hi> whether you refer to Scripture, or any thing elſe.</p>
               <p n="16">§. 16. Yet it cannot but be worth our Notice, That your Method of maintaining your Church is moſt eaſie and expedite. When you find your ſelves unable particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to prove your performance of thoſe things which your Councils require to the making your Inſtitutions valid, yet your work is done by <hi>ſaying,</hi> We are the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, which God hath promiſed to preſerve to the World's end; and therefore all we require will be certainly performed, though we cannot <hi>otherwiſe</hi> make it out.</p>
               <p>You may alſo prove all your more ſpeculative Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines (had you a thouſand more than you have) by the ſame eaſie Method. We are the onely Church, <hi>you may ſay,</hi> to which God hath promiſed his Spirit to lead us into all Truth, and therefore our Articles cannot be falſe, tho' we cannot <hi>otherwiſe</hi> prove them to be true.</p>
               <p n="17">§. 17. If this be ſufficient, how imprudent have many of your Men been, to ſpend their pains, and health, and time, about evincing your particular Points to be founded on Revelation, when a few general Words would have done it to rational Satisfaction. Beſides, as Cart loads of Books, on this ſuppoſition, are unneceſſarily written, ſo the Readers of them are at unneceſſary expence of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys in buying them, and of labour in peruſing them. What an eaſie World ſhould we have had, if this your
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:50192:65"/>Method had all-along generally obtained. To ſhorten the way to knowledge is a praiſe-worthy enterprize, and to teach how to defend truth without care and trouble is a mighty thing. Well; You have ſhewed us an expedite Art of Controverſie, and ſuch as may be taught even il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate Plow-men in half an hours time. And I leave it to the Reader to determine, whether a Plowman of your Perſwaſion, could have ſaid leſs in this Matter, than you have done, <hi>We are the Onely Church,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="18">§. 18. However, conſider, Sir, This you uſe, is but an <hi>accidental</hi> Argument, and can beſtead you no longer, if any other Body of Chriſtians ſhall pleaſe to call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Catholick Church, without offering the leaſt proof of it. Which is moſt apparently your caſe <hi>here.</hi> The <hi>Donatiſts</hi> of old, who appropriated to themſelves the name of the Catholick Church, might have eaſily quelled all Arguments brought againſt them, at your rate of anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: For the ſaid name being arrogated, and the premiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes belonging to it, all the reſt will follow readily.</p>
               <p n="19">§. 19. If you think to relieve your ſelf by ſaying, I am bound to <hi>accept</hi> any deductions you ſhall make from any of your Principles, I <hi>reply,</hi> no ſurely. I was indeed to <hi>prove</hi> a Point from ſome of them, and have, I hope, done it. The more you ſpeak of That, I fear you expoſe your ſelf the more to deriſion.</p>
               <p n="20">§. 20. From the view of your Anſwer, it will appear, that though you called to me, out of due time, for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of more than a few Terms, yet you have not had the heart to explain one of them in your Anſwer, neither what you mean by <hi>Intention,</hi> nor what by <hi>Certainty,</hi> nor any of the reſt. Inſtead of ſaying, what is the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar nature of the Intention required by your Church, you deſcribe it no otherwiſe than thus—<hi>Whatſoever Intention of the Prelates is by them believed as neceſſary—.</hi> Inſtead of telling us the particular nature of your knowledge of the Intention, you only ſay, <hi>I deny not that it may ſufficiently be known—.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:50192:65"/>
               <p>You have no mind it ſeems to ſwim out of your depth, it being a ſilly thing to court danger: nor are you ſo hardy a Champion as to ſtep a few paces out of your hold to meet an enemy, being mindful enough of the old Proverb, <hi>It is good ſleeping in a whole skin.</hi> Your frank opening your ſelf this way might have led me, if I had miſtook any thing of yours, to the true mark, but could not have cauſed my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion from it; and therefore though you were not bound in rigour (further than to make your Anſwer appoſite and uſeful) to have done this, yet it would have lookt brave and generous to have done it. Whether others ſhall interpret your carriage in this kind to be due caution or no, I ſhall not concern my ſelf. Nevertheleſs I muſt ſay this, you knew the point muſt be beaten out at laſt, and it had been manly to have contributed ſomething towards it: whereas he that knew not the particular Nature of the Subject before, knows it but very little better by any help you give him in your Anſwer. I hope the Reader will excuſe me for ſtaying a little too long here, in recompence of the labour I have been at in the firſt part of this Tractate, to make the ſtate of the queſtion plain to him.</p>
               <p n="20">§. 20. Whatſoever ſhall become of any <hi>higher</hi> Certainty which you cannot challenge me to yield upon Principles you have hitherto barely beg'd, without offering the leaſt colour of proof for them; you ſeem to have a mind to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to your ſelf a <hi>moral</hi> Certainty of the Intention of your Biſhops in <hi>general.</hi> Your words are theſe,</p>
               <q>
                  <p>It is morally impoſſible that all the Prelates in the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Church ſhould be ſo <hi>malicious</hi> as wilfully to have omitted any thing in Ordination which they believed to be Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to it, and which the Church requires as ſo, ſuppoſing it poſſible for them to do it and not be diſcovered. It is impoſſible for us to believe, according to our Principles, that they ſhould <hi>all</hi> turn devils—and <hi>conſpire</hi> to damn the whole Church— when withal they could propoſe no advantage at all to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by this, but the clean contrary: <hi>Thus you.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:50192:66"/>
               <p>I <hi>Reply:</hi> The Pillar you have placed here for ſupporting your moral certainty of the Intention, is too weak to bear it up. Which will appear by conſidering the following particulars.</p>
               <p n="21">§. 21. 1. You ſay not, It is impoſſible that any one, or ſeveral, or many of your Biſhops ſhould out of Malice withdraw the <hi>required</hi> Intention.</p>
               <p>You only ſay, It is morally impoſſible that <hi>all</hi> ſhould turn devils and conſpire to damn the whole Church—</p>
               <p n="22">§. 22. 2. I ſay, if Some may withhold their Intention through Malice, (which you deny not) Others may upon other accounts omit it, <hi>viz.</hi> for Unbelief, culpable Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, groſs Negligence, natural Inadvertence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſhall ſpeak a little of ſome of theſe.</p>
               <p n="23">§. 23. For <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief.</hi> It is Morally poſſible that ſome of your Biſhops have internally or mentally embraced Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm or Judaiſm notwithſtanding their profeſſion of the Chriſtian Religion. It is notorious that the Inquiſitors of Heretical pravity in <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick kingdoms have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten met with ſuch men, after they had many years lain hid under the diſguiſe of the Chriſtian profeſſion: and is it any way repugnant that the ſame Cloak which frequently covers Merchants and Gentlemen and others, ſhould cover Prieſts and Biſhops alſo? Now theſe disbelieving the virtue of all Chriſtian Inſtitutions, and that of Ordination in particular; nay judging them to be the devices of certain Politick men, or the Off-ſpring of deluded Fancies, may omit <hi>Intending</hi> in their Ordinations, without deſigning to damn or otherwiſe hurt the Ordained party.</p>
               <p n="24">§. 24. For <hi>Culpable Ignorance,</hi> which the Schools call <hi>Antecedent.</hi> It is morally poſſible that more than a few in your Church have in ſeveral ages been promoted to the dignity of Biſhops, who have been men of very little Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and much lazineſs, and ſo may have faln ſhort of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either That your Church requires the ſaid Intention at all, or at leaſt under the ſaid Neceſſity: and no wonder
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:50192:66"/>then if they may have omitted it. But here is yet no <hi>malice</hi> nor <hi>devils</hi> in the caſe; for I may ſuppoſe if ſuch had known it, they would have rouſed up themſelves to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of their duty.</p>
               <p n="25">§. 25. For <hi>Supine Negligence:</hi> It is too frequently ſeen that many groſly ſlight and neglect thoſe duties which yet they know are to be done for the good of others, without harbouring any malicious deſign againſt them.</p>
               <p n="26">§. 26. It is enough to hint to the Reader, that the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may fail through occaſional Cares, or Fears, or Croſſes, or deep Studies (ſpoken of before) which either put the Thoughts often to long ſtands or pauſes, or elſe hurry them away from duty elſe whiter. Many men are enabled by ſad experience to conceive this I have ſaid, to be very probable.</p>
               <p n="27">§. 27. Beſides <hi>Natural Inadvertence</hi> incident to all men, There is in many a very dull unactive temper of Mind ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing either from Natural Conſtitution, or ſometimes from contracted Bodily diſtempers, whereby the thoughts are many times hindred from riſing higher than to what is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly to be done. And it cannot be denied that it is morally poſſible that ſuch Imperſections may be incident to your Biſhops, (as well as other men) and that their <hi>due In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending</hi> may be obſtructed by them.</p>
               <p n="28">§. 28. Now, Sir, I muſt put you in mind, you have not made any tolerable Enumeration of the Cauſes of the defect of Intention: and while you have only put a Bar againſt an Univerſal Conſpiracy from <hi>malice,</hi> you give room for the defect from all other Cauſes which you have no way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided againſt; and ſo you are ſtark lame in your defence. If you are well acquainted with <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick writers, I wonder you ſhould take up ſo ſhort, ſince they aſſign the ſame Cauſes I have done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Suarez</hi> doth in one place, add to Malice o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two Cauſes of this, among other things, viz. <hi>Culpable ignorance, and Natural Inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertence which excuſeth from ſin</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Sive id fecerit ex malitia, ſive ex ignorantia culpabili, ſive ex naturali inadvertentia quae ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſat peccatum. <hi>Tom. 4. diſp 32.</hi>

               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:50192:67"/>
               <p>And your Authors in their applying Remedies againſt this Evil ſeem to have their eyes chiefly fixed upon other Cauſes than Malice. To ſhew this, and the defectible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Intention, I ſhall produce only-one Teſtimony. It is a paſſage in the famous Maſs-book, <hi>ad <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſum Sarum</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Cautclie Miſſae.</note>.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>If any Prieſt in the time of Conſecration be diſtracted from Actual Intention and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,<note place="margin">Siquis tempore Conſecrationis ab actuali intentions &amp; devotione diſtractus fuerit, nihilominus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrat dummodo intentio habitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis in eo remanſcrit. Si autem per ſummam diſtractionem habitualis intentio cum actuali tollcretur, videtur quod deberet verba con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrationis cum actuali intentione reſumere.</note> he nevertheleſs conſecrates, provided the Habitual Intention remain in him.—. But if through very great diſtraction his Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual Intention be taken away as well as the Actual, it ſeems that he ought to reſume the Words of Conſecration <hi>[ſay them over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain]</hi> with Actual Intention.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Here note, that the words <hi>Habitual</hi> and <hi>Virtual</hi> have the very ſame ſignification, as to our caſe: and that <hi>Aquinas</hi> with the other elder Schoolmen deſcribed this Intention by the word <hi>Habitual,</hi> till <hi>Scotus</hi> his time, who ſubſtituted the word <hi>Virtual</hi> as more proper to expreſs the ſaid Notion, and is followed ever ſince by the writers of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
               <p n="29">§. 29. Now I go on to ſay (1.) This paſſage of the Maſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book is an expreſs acknowledgment, that Prieſts when they do the Exterior work of Conſecration may fail to Intend both Actually and Virtually. <hi>Which upon the ſame ground is equally applicable to Biſhops with reſpect to Ordination.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) It preſcribes this Remedy againſt the ſaid defect, that the Offending Prieſt go to the work again, and do it better. I wiſh the advice had power to neceſſitate thoſe it is addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to, to follow it. But that (alas!) cannot be hoped for.</p>
               <p n="30">§. 30. (3.) This advice is not offered to ſuch as withdraw their Intention through perſonal malice, or contempt of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, (which is the thing I here directly aimed to ſhew,) but to ſuch as fail by <hi>inadvertence</hi> or diſperſion of thoughts.</p>
               <p>And ſuch are omitted in this addreſs perhaps for this Reaſon, That ſuch cannot be well lookt upon as capable
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:50192:67"/>(in any proximate degree) of the Advice given, whereas ſome, at leaſt, of thoſe other careleſs blundering (yet cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable) Prieſts may.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) I obſerve once again, from the ſcope of the cited paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, againſt a certain Perſon I mentioned before, That the diſtraction or diſturbance here mentioned, as the Cauſe of the failure of the Intention, cannot be meant of the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Frenzy or Madneſs. For, 1. The Advice is offered to ſuch as perceive their own defect, which Mad men, as ſuch, cannot do. 2. Wiſe men (and ſuch I hope the Compilers of the <hi>Sarum</hi>-Miſſal will be held to be) adviſe that Phyſick be given to Mad-men for the Recovery of their Reaſon, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than directions to act wiſely by, which ſuppoſeth them already in the ſtate of it. If a Mad-man (who had gained a Habit of Baptizing before his diſtemper) ſhould ruſh into a Houſe, and waſh an Infant, newly born, with the Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the moſt Bleſſed Trinity, no wiſe Man would deſire him to do it again with due heed and Actual Intention, his ſuppoſed condition, forbidding him either to hit the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at firſt, or to amend it in the repeated Action. This ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice then given, muſt be concluded to be directed to perſons capable of receiving it; which therefore cannot be frantick Prieſts. Hereby is confounded the affirmation of the Prieſt I point at, viz. <hi>That none but madmen could fail to intend aright.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="31">§. 31. You fee, Sir, ſeveral purpoſes are ſerved by this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, beſides that I directly brought it for, but all of them tend to the illuſtration of the Subject treated of. I ſhall only add this at parting with it, That it is not to be lookt upon as a ſingle Teſtimony only, but inſtead of a thouſand ſuch, as implying the judgment of all thoſe Clergymen, who uſed and approved that renowned <hi>Miſſal.</hi> And what a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able part of our Nation that Book obtained in, before that of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the <hi>V.</hi> was framed for the general Uniformity of your Worſhip, I leave you to think of: and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what a vaſt Company of your Clergy (who ſure were the beſt Judges in this caſe) did implicitely and by true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:50192:68"/>acknowledge, that there may be a defect of the Intention, both Actual and Virtual, which may proceed from other Cauſes, than that of Malice, which yet is the only thing alledged by you to that purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="32">§. 32. Next, as an enforcement why there could be no malicious conſpiracy of your Prelates, you add this, <hi>They could not,</hi> ſay you, <hi>propoſe any advantage to themſelves by it, but the clean contrary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But you forget the <hi>Genius</hi> of Malice, to which doing miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief is an agreeable thing, without any allurements of Worldly profits, or the like. Remember the ſad Inſtance of Satan's murdering our firſt Parents. This I ſay not, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving any ſuch conſpiracy; nor is the fancying ſuch a thing at all needful to my buſineſs, having ſhewed that what Malice may do in ſome, the ſame may other Cauſes effect in others, as to the ſpoiling of the Intention: I ſay it only to ſhew that to be weakneſs, which you bring to ſtrengthen your Ground.</p>
               <p n="33">§. 33. There will need no conſpiracy of any ſort to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you uncertain of the validity of your Ordainer's Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if you remember what I ſaid before, (after the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch of my firſt task) <hi>viz.</hi> That all the defects of Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in your Ordaining Biſhops from the Apoſtles death, hitherto, are chargeable upon, and utterly diſable all that are reputed to derive power from them; and that the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the Line is ſpun out by time, there will be more Nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the Intention, both of Biſhops and Prieſts.</p>
               <p n="34">§. 34. To rivet this, I ask, What if the Catholick Church for many Ages after <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not require this Intention, as neceſſAry to the Sacraments? If ſo, the grand Motive to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilance and heedfulneſs of Intending was wanting, and ſo it is more probable, defects might then ariſe, which might baffle and enervate the greateſt care and circumſpection of ſucceeding Biſhops. I cannot find that it was uninterrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly ſo required; but if you can, I intreat you to ſhew it.</p>
               <p>The Sum hereof is, (1.) You have attempted to arm
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:50192:68"/>your ſelf only againſt one of the many Cauſes of defect of Intention, letting in the reſt like a Flood upon you. (2.) You have falſly ſuppoſed, that the effectual valid Intention can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have failed in your Church, without an Univerſal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy of the Biſhops of one Age: Whereas the defect may have been let in by degrees, and ſo may have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread your Church, for any thing you have ſaid to the contrary on this Head.</p>

               <q>
                  <p>Predeſtination to life is the everlaſting purpoſe of God, whereby He hath conſtantly decreed by his Counſel, <hi>ſecret to us,</hi> to deliver from curſe and damnation <hi>thoſe whom he hath

               </p>
               <p>'Tis our Principle, you ſee, That ſome in God's Church belong to the Election of Grace; and that God will make good his Promiſes by Saving them. But we deſcend no lower, nor need we, as thinking it ſufficient for any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church to be able to ſay,</p>
               <p>We have all neceſſary Doctrine, both <hi>Dogmatical</hi> and <hi>Moral,</hi> and may be Saved, if we truly Believe, and Sincerely obey it; to both which God in his mercy call us.

                  <p>And you will allow this alſo as a Principle, That theſe Elect must have true Saving Grace in their Hearts, as a Condition neceſſary to their Salvation.</p>
               </q>
               <p>This, Sir, I acknowledge to be one of the Principles of our Church, and of all other Chriſtian Churches in the World.</p>
               <p>Then you proceed from hence to add this,</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Which ſaving grace, becauſe you do not know to be in any particular man, therefore you cannot be certain that He is one of thoſe that is Elected to Salvation. <hi>Which is unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably true.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>Now I am to examine your Forms of Argumentation, pretended to be parallel to thoſe, I urged againſt you. Your firſt is thus,</p>
               <q>
                  <p>That Church which makes Salvation depend upon a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which no Man living knows, whether it be fulfill'd, in order to Salvation, must be <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertain whether they have any, who ſhall be ſaved in their Communion. But the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church doth ſo. <hi>Ergo,</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertain, whether they have any which ſhall be ſaved in their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
               </q>
               <p n="4">§. 4. Now becauſe you ſay, <hi>The Argument may be thus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to any Chriſtian Church in the World, or to all of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;</hi> I ſhall alter the Form a little, and make it reſpect all of them. Thus it goes,</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Whoſoever makes Salvation depend upon a Condition, which no Man living knows, whether it be fulfill'd in Order to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:50192:70"/>muſt be <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertain whether they have any who ſhall be ſaved in their Communion. But all the Chriſtian Churches in the world put together, do ſo. <hi>Ergo,</hi> All the Chriſtian Churches in the world put together, are <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertain whether they have any which ſhall be ſaved in their Communion.</p>
               </q>
               <p>In regard, I ſay, One and all Chriſtian Churches fare alike, according to your own acknowledgment, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to this Argument, I have placed this latter form alſo in view. And what I ſhall ſay of them, is as follows.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. I ſhall admit the parity of either of theſe Syllogiſms with my <hi>firſt,</hi> under your own Notion of them newly mentioned: yet muſt tell you, in my way to your other, that though you made a diſtinction, and, at leaſt, unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily applied it to my firſt Propoſition, and thereupon cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly pronounced it falſe; yet I ſhall not imitate you in your indiſcretion; but grant your <hi>Major,</hi> as generally put, to be true, becauſe of the Connexion of a neceſſary Condition with That it is required to: whether it be <hi>in deed</hi> neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or only ſo in the <hi>Eſtimation</hi> of the Church that requires it. For the Not-knowing a Condition to be fulfilled, upon which the Being of a Thing is ſuſpended, evidently ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitates the Uncertainty of the Thing it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. Pray know, Sir, had I not been prevented by your Compliance and Conceſſions, I would have dealt more diſtinctly with relation to the Inſtance you have put before I had given an Anſwer to it. I would <hi>in time</hi> have asked you a few of thoſe queſtions you asked me <hi>out of time,</hi> as what Knowledge or Certainty you denied in your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or parted the ſundry ſenſes my ſelf, and applied them; but I perceive I now need not.</p>
               <p>I ſhall then only deny the <hi>Minor</hi> which you prove in this manner,</p>
               <q>
                  <p>True Grace in the Heart is a Condition which no man living knows whether it be fulfill'd or no in Order to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church [<hi>or,</hi> all Chriſtian Churches put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether—] requires Grace in the Heart in Order to Salvation. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:50192:70"/>
                  <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church [<hi>or,</hi> all Chriſtian Churches put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther—] requires a Condition in Order to Salvation, which no man living knows whether it be fulfill'd or no.</p>
               </q>
               <p n="7">§. 7. Before I ſpeak to this, I advertiſe That you here pretend only to make one man Uncertain of the truth of Grace in another man's Heart, as I did to make one man Uncertain of another's Intention when you gave this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. And indeed the making your Inſtance a parallel to mine confines the ſenſe hither. So that here is, according to your ſelf, room left for every man to judge as well as he can, of his own Grace, and ſo whether he be one of God's Elect. Which thing falls not here into diſpute.</p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. This premiſed, I will thus diſtinguiſh in the <hi>Major</hi> of this Syllogiſm, of true Grace <hi>in the Heart.</hi> By Grace <hi>in the Hearts of men</hi> is meant either— in the Hearts of men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered <hi>[determinatè] in particular,</hi> or— in the Hearts of men conſidered <hi>[indeterminatè, vel in confuſo] in general.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">§. 9. If when you ſay True Grace in the Heart is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition which no man living knows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you mean it of men <hi>in particular,</hi> I will freely grant your Propoſition to be true. For no man hath full certainty that another hath true Grace in his Heart, God having reſerved that prerogative to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>who is the only ſearcher of the heart</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.10.</note>.</p>
               <p n="10">§. 10. But then I add, my granting this brings no diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage at all upon us. The Knowledge of our having the true means of Grace, (with their Effects) as God's holy Word and Sacraments, and Perſons duly Authorized to Adminiſter them (the Knowledge hereof, I ſay) is not any whit obſtructed or clouded by our ignorance of another man's grace: inaſmuch as a graceleſs man may be a true Miniſter of them, and the Efficacy of divine Ordinances de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the merciful Operation of their Inſtitutor, and not on the Grace of thoſe that Adminiſter them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the other ſide, your ignorance of the Intention of your Miniſters <hi>in particular,</hi> renders you Uncertain whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you have the true means of Grace, and conſequently
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:50192:71"/>the Benefits God is ordinarily wont to confer by them; as hath above been ſhewn. Which amounts to a vaſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
               <p n="11">§. 11. But if you mean it of Grace in the Hearts of men taken <hi>in general,</hi> (which acception alone your Inſtance ſeems to reſpect) So that the Senſe of the Propoſition is This, True Grace in the Heart of ſome or other, ſome where or other, is a Condition which no man living knows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">§. 12. I, without more ado, deny your <hi>Major</hi> as utterly falſe in this Senſe: and ſo may either diſmiſs you <hi>re infecta,</hi> or put you to the trouble of making another Syllogiſm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I need to aſſign the manner of Knowledge, whereby we know Grace to be in ſome or others. But I will be good natur'd and ſupply your defect. You ſhould then have gone on to urge to this purpoſe.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>If true Grace in the heart be a Condition which any man living knows whether it be performed in order to Salvation, then he knows it either by ſome Principles evidently grounded on divine Revelation, or ſome other way.</p>
                  <p>But he knows it neither by any Principles evidently ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon divine Revelation, nor any other way: <hi>Ergo,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Grace in the heart is a Condition which no man living knows whether it be performed in order to Salvation.</p>
               </q>
               <p n="13">§. 13. Now, Sir, and not till now, am I obliged to aſſign the way by which true Grace may be known to be in ſome or others, though we know not who. Upon my denial of the <hi>Minor</hi> when you are pleaſed to ſay, <hi>ad partes,</hi> I muſt tell which way I know it, or give up my Cauſe.</p>
               <p n="14">§. 14. Well. Without the formality of your diſtinction I ſay, This may be known by a Knowledge grounded immediately on divine Revelation. The whole of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter appears in Scripture.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When our B. Saviour promiſeth <hi>That the gates of hell ſhall not</hi> prevail againſt his Church<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Matt.</hi> 16.18.</note> : He ſaith in effect, that in deſpight of men and devils, he will at all times even to the worlds end maintain ſome in his true Faith and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and alſo ſave them at laſt.</p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:50192:71"/>
               <p n="2">2. He determines true Grace or Purity of heart to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in order to the Salvation of ſuch. <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart for they ſhall ſee God</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.8.</note>. Which words by true and unqueſtionable implication exclude all impure perſons from Salvation.</p>
               <p>But in many Texts ſuch are formally excluded from it. <hi>Without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord</hi>
                  <note n="‖" place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb</hi> 12.14.</note>.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His promiſe to maintain and continue ſuch a people cannot fail by reaſon of his divine Perfections— <hi>God that cannot lye promiſed</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2.</note>. <hi>He is faithful that hath promiſed</hi>
                  <note n="‖" place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.23.</note>.</p>
               <p n="15">§. 15. Thus according to expreſs Scripture we find, that Grace in the heart is neceſſary to Salvation: that God hath promiſed he will ever preſerve and ſave ſome in the world who are Faithful and Gracious: that his promiſe cannot fail. All which put together truly grounds our Knowledge, that there is true Grace in ſome Members of the Chriſtian Church, though we know not who or where they are in particular.</p>
               <p>Thus have I ſpoke to your Argument conſidered in itſelf, and this more regularly than you have done to mine, if I flatter not my ſelf.</p>
               <p n="16">§. 16. But that which is the main concern, I do not find that parity you pretend there is between your ſecond and mine: pray where find you in the divine Oracles that the Intention I have deſcribed, is as neceſſary to the Being of the Sacraments, as they teach that Grace is to the being Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Had God indeed knit them individually together, and declared the neceſſary dependence the Sacraments have of this Intention, we ſhould have been ſure from divine war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty (as I have proved we are in the matter of Grace) that ſome Biſhops and Prieſts in God's Church have from time to time duly Intended. But alas! you have exhibited no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of divine Revelation to ſhew this; the chaffy general words you have given have nothing of weight or cogency in them. This grand diſparity is very apparent, and you have ſaid nothing to hinder any man from apprehending it ſuch; and ſo the deſign of your Inſtance is defeated, and ſhares with the reſt of your Anſwer in its misfortunes.</p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:50192:72"/>
               <p n="17">§. 17. I may well forbear to ſpeak of other things; for, Fancy what promiſes you pleaſe, as peculiarly made to Men of your Communion, yet know, God is not bound to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Men to believe and perform what himſelf hath not made neceſſary, in order to Grace and Salvation.</p>
               <p n="18">§. 18. I ſhall now, Sir, deſire the Proteſtant Reader to remember, as an Antidote againſt Temptations from <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, the uncertain comfortleſs Eſtate you are in. For pick you out the moſt diſcerning Layman amongſt you, and ſuppoſe all your reputed Clergy to paſs leiſurely by him, one by one, yet he ſhall not upon ſure Grounds be able to ſay, of any of the whole Number, This is a true Biſhop, or a true Prieſt: Nor can any of Them with better Warranty affirm of themſelves, I am ſuch a One.</p>
               <p>Nor can one Member of your whole Body aſſuredly ſay, I have once in my life time been partaker of one true Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. All this I have made good.</p>
               <p>If you could ſay, ſome or other of our Clergy are true Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Prieſts; and ſome or other of our Body have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived true Sacraments, tho' we know not who, or where thoſe are; yet it is a very lamentable thing for each of you to be uncertain concerning himſelf, and uncapable of apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe Mercies to any particular Perſons. And yet it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears you have taken no great Care to ſecure even this <hi>heartleſs</hi> General Good to your Church.</p>
               <p>Had you armed your Paper with any particular ſtrength, with relation hereunto, you ſhould have found me an eaſie Enemy, inaſmuch as I had not, nor needed to have, any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign that way upon you, what I have done otherwiſe, being ſufficient to expoſe your Nakedneſs.</p>
               <p>SIR, After you have delivered what you call your <hi>Full</hi> Anſwer, (which I have examined) you write ſomething more, though not under that Notion. And that I may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear juſt and fair to your Expectation, I will in ſhort ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Reader, what the Severals of it are; and ſubjoin a few Words to each of them.</p>
               <p n="1">§. 1. 1. You deſire me to declaro, What our Doctrine is of the Subject in queſtion.</p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:50192:72"/>
               <p>Anſwer. It was the only buſineſs I undertook, to diſtreſs you with Conſequents from your own Doctrin; and while I am a doing this, you call to me, Pray, Sir, What is the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of your Church? Now let the World judg, whether your requeſt be not a calling me off from my proper Work, and very probably ſeeking an Occaſion to leap aſide from your Province. For whatever we hold, (which yet you was long enough a Student amongſt us to under ſtand) what could my telling you that, boot you, ſo long as I evince that your own Doctrine intails afflictions on you?</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. 2. You call for an Explication of ſeveral Terms.</p>
               <p>Anſwer. I have told you how unſeaſonable your Call was, but withall have done at large what you requeſted.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. 3. You ſay, It would have been more for the Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of my Proteſtant Auditors, if I would have proved (as you propoſed) the Lawfulneſs of our Separating, at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Reformation, from every Communion of Chriſtians in the World: or that any one Term of your Communion (you ſay, you gave me my Choice) was Unlawful, or juſt Ground of our Separation.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. Anſwer, 1. Among ſundry other things then ſtarted, thoſe you ſpeak of were indeed mentioned, and I gave ſuch Grounds of Reſolutions of them, as ſeemed ſufficient to my ſelf, and the Proteſtant Auditors. And I gave more than you had a Mind of, for when I was laying down the Terms of Chriſtian Communion, you flung off from the Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, ſaying theſe Words, <hi>You now enter into the Merits of the Cauſe!</hi> As if that was no time or place for it. And this the Auditors ſay, They very well remember.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. 2. Your great Undertaking is well worth obſerving. You take no leſs upon you, than to maintain for juſt and lawful, every Term the <hi>Roman</hi> Church requires to her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. Your Province is Wide, and requires an Univerſal skill in the Controverſies between the two Churches, as will thus appear. (1.) She requires the Belief of all thoſe Articles your Councils have defined to be Matter of Faith. And theſe will be found not a few, if we compare Pope <hi>Pius</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:50192:73"/>his, with the Ancient Creeds. (2.) She requires an Aſſent to, and Compliance with your whole Worſhip. Now each of theſe Articles you are, it ſeems, furniſh'd to maintain, as alſo the whole frame of your Worſhip: and this not againſt me onely, but alſo againſt Dr. <hi>Wr.</hi> Mr. <hi>P.</hi> and (for ought I know) all Comers.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. Sir, I love courage in any Man, but I love Caution too. Pray tell me, How it happens, that in your Study of Theology, for full <hi>twenty</hi> years in our Communion, you were not able to find one of their diſtinguiſhing Articles defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; and now in One years time ſee them all perſpicuous and ſurely founded. Your concern to ſearch for truth was the ſame before, as lately, your Purſe enabled you to buy Books, and your Education and Parts to read them, and you will not, I ſuppoſe, be Unwilling We ſhould believe you weighed the Arguments on both ſides. Pray then tell us, how, all at once, you hapned to find all thoſe Points we call Popery, to be Warranted by Divine Authority.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. If you be inſpired, I am ſure to have the worſe in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending with you. If you be not, I have no reaſon to dread your Challenge.</p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. But I have found out your ſtrength; you can juſtifie all your particular Points with a few begg'd general words, viz. <hi>We are the only Catholick Church, and therefore whatſoever We teach for Faith, cannot ſail of being true. And what we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire as neceſſary, cannot fail of being done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">§. 9. I confeſs you are able at this rate to baffle all the Proteſtants in the World, and on that Score may dare us, even from <hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Beerſheba.</hi> But we onely ſmile at ſuch impotent conceits.</p>
               <p>I have ſet forth the Matter of this laſt part of your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, though our preſent Controverſie is not touched in it, that You may have no Colour to Complain, I have ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed any thing of Yours.</p>
               <p n="10">§. 10. It was my onely buſineſs to preſent You with a View, of the Feeble Eſtate of Your Church, which I hope I have performed, and ſo reſt,</p>
